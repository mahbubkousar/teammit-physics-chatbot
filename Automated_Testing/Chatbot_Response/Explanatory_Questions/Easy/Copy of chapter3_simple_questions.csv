What is the difference between inertia of rest and inertia of motion?,"Inertia of rest means an object tends to stay at rest, while inertia of motion means an object tends to continue moving.",Explanatory,Easy,2024-10-26 07:02:11,"## Inertia in Motion vs. Inertia at Rest

**The text explains the concept of inertia but doesn't differentiate between its meaning in rest or motion.**  This excerpt focuses on a general idea about inertia, which is a body's tendency to maintain its current state of motion or rest.

","Page Unknown: That is both the two friends are in motion with respect to the person standing by the side of the train line.</p> <p>So we see that an object is actually in rest or not depends on the reference object. If the reference frame is actually in rest, object in rest will be : actually in rest with respect to that frame. This type of rest is called absolute rest. A body is said to be in absolutely rest when it is in rest with respect to an absolutely rest object. Similarly absolute motion of a body is its motion with respect to a reference object absolutely at rest. But in this universe it is not possible to get a reference object which is at absolute rest. Since the earth is continuously moving round the sun, while the sun itself is moving along the galaxy with its planets and satellites. Thus when we say that a body is at rest or in motion, we mean it is to be so with respect to a body apparently at rest. So we can say that in this universe all rest and all motion are relative. No rest or no motion is absolute.</p> <p>Mitu is waiting for a bus at the bus stand to go somewhere. She notices her friend Roni crossing her by rickshaw. She says that the rickshaw is in motion because it is changing its position continuously with respect to time.</p> <p>The change of position of a body may take place in two ways. Let us consider the following example : a) Mou is standing under a tree and sees that her friend Awishi is running away from her.

Will it be in the same place in the next morning? What do we observe from these practical experiences? It is observed that the bodies at rest are still at rest. These bodies can't move by themselves. Suppose that one of your friends is riding a bi-cycle on a plane road. At any moment he stopped paddling the cycle. Will the cycle stop at once? We find that the cycle will stop slowly after crossing a small distance. Would the cycle move continuously if there is no air resistance and friction? From this evidence we can understand that everybody has the tendency to remain in the same state as it is. If the body is at rest it continues to be at rest. On the other hand if the body is in motion it continues to be in motion. This tendency or property of a body to maintain its own state is called inertia. Thus the tendency of a body to maintain its own state for ever in which the body is at present or the property of a body to preserve that state is defined as inertia. The inertia of a body depends on its mass. That is, mass is the measure of its inertia. The more the mass, the more the inertia of a body. "
Why do passengers lean backwards when a bus suddenly starts moving?,"Passengers lean backwards due to the inertia of rest, where the upper part of their body tends to remain stationary.",Explanatory,Easy,2024-10-26 07:02:11,"##  Inertia and the Passenger's Lean Backwards

 Passengers lean backwards when a bus suddenly starts moving because of **inertia**. 

**Here's why:**

* **Inertial Motion:** A body at rest wants to remain at rest, and a body in motion wants to continue moving in a straight line at the same speed. This is inertia.
* **Inertia at Rest vs. Inertia in Motion:**  When a bus comes to a sudden stop, passengers are thrown forward against the seat belts due to inertia of motion, which was established when the bus was in motion. But, When the bus starts moving suddenly, the passengers' bodies continue to move forward as if they were still at rest, but now with respect to the changing speed of the bus.

**The Effect:** 
*  As the bus accelerates from rest, the body (the passenger) is essentially lagging behind the motion of the bus because of inertia of rest.

In both cases to apply force, it needs direct contact between the force applier and the body. These types of force are known as contact force. If the two bodies are not in direct contact, still they can apply force on each other. Such a well-known force is the force of gravitation, whose practical example is the weight of a body. When a body falls from your hand, then it quickly touches the ground. What is the reason? It happens due to the weight or attraction of the earth on the body. We define this force as the force of gravitation. In this way we feel the existence of different type of forces in different events of nature. For example- the magnetic force between two poles of a magnet, the electrical force between two charged bodies, nuclear force within the nucleus.

Why do drivers wear seat belts while driving?,"Drivers wear seat belts for safety, as it prevents them from moving forward due to inertia when the car suddenly stops.",Explanatory,Easy,2024-10-26 07:02:11,"Drivers wear seat belts for a crucial reason: **to mitigate the risk of serious injury or death in an accident**. 

Here's how it works:

* **Inertia and Sudden Braking:**  When a car suddenly stops, passengers continue moving forward due to inertia. Without a seat belt, they can be thrown against the steering wheel, dashboard, windows, or other parts of the vehicle with immense force. This can cause injuries such as whiplash, broken bones, and even head trauma.
* **Crash Protection:** Seat belts restrain passengers during collisions by holding them firmly in their seats. This helps to distribute their weight across a broader area, reducing the risk of these devastating impacts.

**In short, seatbelts are crucial safety features that help drivers and passengers survive car crashes.**

In addition, he has to properly adjust the mirrors used in the car.</p> <p>At first the driver and the passengers will wear the seat belt during driving time. It is observed that most of the road accidents occur due to very fast driving. So, the driver must be cautious to control the speed of the car. The kinetic energy becomes more due to increased speed. For example- if the velocity of the car is doubled, its kinetic energy is increased by four times in comparison to that of the earlier value. If the velocity is increased by three times, kinetic energy is increased by nine times. Then it becomes difficult to reduce or to control the velocity and the accident becomes terrible.</p> <p>Drivers are advised to choose a vehicle which they are used to driving earlier. It is not wise to try to drive a new vehicle suddenly. It is observed that the youth try to drive a new car emotionally. It's not proper at all.

It **does not address** whether an object at rest can ""move itself"".

Here's a breakdown to understand this:

* **Inertial Objects:** An object at rest will resist any change in its state of being. This means they want to stay still, unless acted upon by an external force (like a push or pull). 
* **Movement Requires Force:**  For an object to move, a force (push, pull, friction, etc.) is needed to overcome inertia. 

**Therefore, no object at rest can move itself. It needs a force acting on it.**

What happens to a bicycle when the rider stops paddling?,The bicycle will slow down and eventually stop due to air resistance and friction.,Explanatory,Easy,2024-10-26 07:02:11,"Here's why the bicycle won't move by itself and what happens as the rider stops paddling:

* **Inertia:** The bicycle, like all objects at rest, wants to stay still.
* **No Force:**  Without the rider pedaling, no external force is pushing the bike forward. 
* **Stopping:** Once the rider stops pedaling, their momentum (the movement they were carrying) slows down. This means the bicycle will eventually come to a stop. The friction between the tires and the ground also slows it down.

**In summary:** A bicycle at rest will not move unless acted upon by an external force like pushing or pulling.

Now if closing the stop cock a little amount water is poured into A tube, the amount of water in it will still be less than that of B, but the height of water level will increase slightly. After if the stop cock is opened, then water will flow from A to and the height of the water column will w same in both A and B. It is thus understood that flow of water does not depend on the amount of water rather the height. Suppose two conductors are positively charged. The amount of charge in first conductor is greater than that of second conductor but the potential of the first one is less than that of the second. Now if, two conductors are connected electricity then positively charge will flow from second conductor to first conductor. Though the amount of charge is greater in first conductor yet it will take charge because its potential is low.

Newton's first law expresses the property of inertia of matter. From Newton's first law of motion we observe that a body cannot change its state on its own. If the body is at rest, it tends to remain at rest forever and if it is in motion it tends to keep on motion with uniform speed for all time. This property of a body is termed as inertia.

Why is it harder to move a heavier object than a lighter one?,It is harder to move a heavier object because it has greater inertia due to its greater mass.,Explanatory,Easy,2024-10-26 07:02:11,"Here's why it's harder to move a heavier object than a lighter one: 

* **Resistance to Change in Motion:**  Heavier objects have greater inertia. Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its motion. The more mass an object has, the more difficult it is to get it moving or change its speed.
* **Force Required:**  To move an object requires a force that overcomes its inertia and potentially any friction with the surface. Because heavier objects have more mass, you need to apply a greater force to achieve the same level of acceleration. 

**Think of it like this:** Imagine pushing a shopping cart full of heavy groceries versus a light one. The heavier cart needs much more effort to get moving because of its greater inertia.

","Page Unknown: This resistive force is called frictional force.</p> <p>The frictional force always acts opposite to the motion and obstructs the motion.</p> <h2>Origin Of Friction</h2> <p>Whenever the surface of an object slides over the surface of another object, each object exerts a frictional force on the other. The question arises- why friction occur? Friction is the result of the surface irregularities of any two surfaces. Each object has a surface. Again, the surface may be smooth or rough. Apparently, the surface of an object seems to be smooth, but it is observed that there are high and low grooves on it when viewed by a microscope [Figure 3.8]. When an object moves on another object, then the grooves of the two surfaces in contact catch onto one another. As a result of which the motion of one surface over another surface gets obstacled.</p> <p>As the grooves of a surface deepend and their number increases i.e. as the surface become rougher, the motion of one surface over another becomes more obstructed. Then the magnitude of frictional force also increases. The body becomes mobile if it can overcome the resistance of the surface in contact.

The inertia of a body depends on its mass. That is, mass is the measure of its inertia. The more the mass, the more the inertia of a body.

What is the role of inertia in a moving object?,"Inertia plays a crucial role in a moving object, as it tends to maintain the object's state of motion, making it difficult to change its velocity or direction.",Explanatory,Easy,2024-10-26 07:02:11,"Inertia plays a vital role in how a moving object behaves. It essentially describes an object's resistance to changes in its state of motion, whether it's at rest or in motion.  

Here's a breakdown of how inertia affects a moving object:

* **Maintaining Motion:** When a moving object is subjected to no external forces (like friction), it will continue to move at the same speed and direction in a straight line for as long as there isn't a force trying to change its motion. 
* **Reaction to Forces:**  When an external force acts on a moving object, inertia dictates how it reacts. It resists changes in its velocity or direction. For instance, when you hit the brakes on a car, your body tends to keep continuing forward due to inertia, but eventually your body and the car come to rest. 
* **Understanding Momentum:** Inertia is closely linked with the concept of momentum.  Momentum is a measure of an object's mass in motion (mass times velocity). The greater the mass or velocity of an object, the more difficult it is to change its motion.

Can a body change its state of motion without any external force?,"No, a body cannot change its state of motion without any external force, due to its inertia.",Explanatory,Easy,2024-10-26 07:02:11,"That's a great series of explanations!  You've clearly laid out the concepts in a clear and easy-to-understand way. 

**Here's an answer to your question:**

No, a body cannot change its state of motion (whether at rest or in motion) without an external force acting on it. 

* **Newton's First Law:** The law states that objects will remain at rest or keep moving at the same speed and direction unless acted upon by a net external force.
* **Inertia:** This fundamental concept explains that objects resist changes to their state of motion, wanting to stay in their current state.

Will it be in the same place in the next morning? What do we observe from these practical experiences? It is observed that the bodies at rest are still at rest. These bodies can't move by themselves. Suppose that one of your friends is riding a bi-cycle on a plane road. At any moment he stopped paddling the cycle. Will the cycle stop at once? We find that the cycle will stop slowly after crossing a small distance. Would the cycle move continuously if there is no air resistance and friction? From this evidence we can understand that everybody has the tendency to remain in the same state as it is. If the body is at rest it continues to be at rest. On the other hand if the body is in motion it continues to be in motion. This tendency or property of a body to maintain its own state is called inertia. Thus the tendency of a body to maintain its own state for ever in which the body is at present or the property of a body to preserve that state is defined as inertia.

Why is it harder to move a heavy object than a light one?,It is harder to move a heavy object because it has more inertia due to its larger mass.,Explanatory,Easy,2024-10-26 07:02:11,"Here's the explanation of why it's harder to move a heavy object than a light one, drawing on the concepts of inertia and force:

**Inertia:**  The key lies in the concept of inertia. 
* A heavier object has more inertia because it has more mass. This means it takes **more effort** to get it moving (or stop it) because it's ""stiffer"" to change its state of motion.
* A lighter object is easier to move because its inertia is lower.

**Forces:** We can also see this in action when you consider the forces needed:

* **Moving a heavy object:** You need to apply more force to overcome its inertia and get it moving. The heavier the object, the greater the force required (the bigger push or pull). 
* **Moving a light object:** A lighter object requires less force because its inertia is lower.  Even if you only use a small amount of force, you'll be able to move it quickly because its mass is lighter and easier to overcome.

**In summary:**  Heavy objects are resistant to changes in motion due to their higher inertia, making them harder to start or stop. While light objects have less resistance and require less effort for the same task.

The question arises- why friction occur? Friction is the result of the surface irregularities of any two surfaces. Each object has a surface. Again, the surface may be smooth or rough. Apparently, the surface of an object seems to be smooth, but it is observed that there are high and low grooves on it when viewed by a microscope [Figure 3.8]. When an object moves on another object, then the grooves of the two surfaces in contact catch onto one another. As a result of which the motion of one surface over another surface gets obstacled.</p> <p>As the grooves of a surface deepend and their number increases i.e. as the surface become rougher, the motion of one surface over another becomes more obstructed.

From Newton's first law of motion we know that if no force acts on a body the body will continue in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line. Does it actually happen in reality? Take a marble and roll it on the floor. When you roll the marble, you apply a force on it. As a result, the marble becomes mobile on the ground. According to Newton's law the marble should remain in uniform velocity. In practice, it is seen that the marble comes to rest after traversing a small distance. This happens due to the friction of the floor. When the marble is in motion on the floor, a frictional force is developed due to the mutual friction between the marble and the floor. This force acts in the direction opposite to the motion and hinders the motion. If the friction of the floor was absent, then the marble would continue its perpetual motion with uniform velocity.</p> <p>When a body moves or tends to move over another body, then a resistance is developed between the two surfaces in contact, which is known as friction.

* **Inertia:**  Objects want to stay in their current state of motion, either at rest or moving at a constant speed in a straight line. 
* **Sudden Acceleration:** When the bus starts moving suddenly, passengers are initially traveling at a ""standstill"" before being pushed forward with the acceleration. This means they'll keep trying to move in their previous direction until it changes due to the sudden force of the change in motion, which is why the inertia wants to continue in its previous state of motion. 
* **Force vs. Inertia:** The bus's driver applies a force (the engine) that causes an acceleration, and this force needs to overcome the passengers' inertia.

What is the purpose of wearing a seatbelt while driving?,"Wearing a seatbelt is for safety, as it helps to prevent the body from moving forward due to inertia during sudden stops.",Explanatory,Easy,2024-10-26 07:02:11,"Seat belts are crucial safety features in vehicles and play a vital role in protecting occupants during collisions. Here's why:

* **Force Distribution:** During a sudden stop or crash, your body will continue to move forward at a high speed due to inertia. The seatbelt anchors your body securely against the car's seats by applying an outward force to resist this forward momentum. This helps distribute the impact of the crash force over a larger area of your body, significantly reducing the risk of serious injury.
* **Reduced Movement:** The seat belt prevents you from being thrown around inside the vehicle or crashing into other passengers. It acts as a restraint system, keeping you safely in place and preventing excessive movement that can cause injuries to vital organs and bones. 
* **Life-Saving Feature:** Seatbelts are proven to significantly reduce fatalities and improve survival rates in car crashes.  Wearing your seat belt is the best way to protect yourself during a collision, saving lives.

For example- if the velocity of the car is doubled, its kinetic energy is increased by four times in comparison to that of the earlier value. If the velocity is increased by three times, kinetic energy is increased by nine times. Then it becomes difficult to reduce or to control the velocity and the accident becomes terrible.</p> <p>Drivers are advised to choose a vehicle which they are used to driving earlier. It is not wise to try to drive a new vehicle suddenly. It is observed that the youth try to drive a new car emotionally. It's not proper at all. Slow down the vehicle's speed when you meet other vehicles from opposite direction. To obey the traffic sign and traffic law is the citizen responsibility of the vehicle driver.

Not only have the drivers, the passengers also had to wear the seat belt if there is an arrangement of seat belt in the car. We have a general concept about force from our daily life experiences. When we pull or push a body, then we say a force is applied upon the body. This applied force can create or tends to create motion in a stationary body. If the body is in motion, then the applied force can cease the motion of the body or tries to increase its velocity. In both cases to apply force, it needs direct contact between the force applier and the body. These types of force are known as contact force. If the two bodies are not in direct contact, still they can apply force on each other. Such a well-known force is the force of gravitation, whose practical example is the weight of a body. When a body falls from your hand, then it quickly touches the ground. What is the reason? It happens due to the weight or attraction of the earth on the body. We define this force as the force of gravitation. In this way we feel the existence of different type of forces in different events of nature. For example- the magnetic force between two poles of a magnet, the electrical force between two charged bodies, nuclear force within the nucleus. Now we will see how we can get concept about inertia and force from Newton's first law of motion. "

* **Net External Force:** It is the overall force acting on an object, taking into account all forces that are applied to it (including gravity).

Why does a bicycle stop slowly after the rider stops pedaling?,"A bicycle stops slowly due to the inertia of motion, which keeps it moving for a short distance.",Explanatory,Easy,2024-10-26 07:02:11,"Here's why a bicycle stops slowly after the rider stops pedaling:

* **Friction:**  There's a lot of friction involved. 
    * **Rolling Friction:** The tires on the road create some friction that slows the bike down, even without braking. This is because the contact patch between the tire and the road creates a resistance to motion. As long as the wheel is moving, there's always this friction trying to slow it down. 
    * **Air Resistance:** Air is also resisting movement of the bicycle. As the bicycle slows down due to the tires, friction against the air becomes more intense. The faster the bike moves, the greater the amount of air resistance slowing the cycle down.  
    * **Brakes:** While brakes are a primary means of stopping a bicycle, their work is often not as effective as friction and therefore does not stop the bike completely by itself.

Many types of problems arise when amount of the frictional force is decreased largely. So, the road should not be too smooth. If the road is too smooth, it is not possible to stop the car within a certain distance in spite of applying brake. The friction is important for the motion of a car.

What is the qualitative concept of force related to Newton's First Law?,The qualitative concept of force is related to the idea that a body will maintain its state unless acted upon by an external force.,Explanatory,Easy,2024-10-26 07:02:11,"The qualitative concept of force related to Newton's First Law of Motion is **inertia**. 

Here's why:

* **Newton's First Law:**  This law states that an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
* **Inertia:** This concept describes an object's inherent resistance to changes in its state of motion (rest or constant velocity). It means objects tend to keep doing what they're already doing until a new force is applied to change their movement.

**In simple terms:**  Newton's First Law highlights that something won't change unless a *force* acts upon it. Inertia, on the other hand, explains why an object resists being changed in its motion and how that resistance plays a role in this law.

Newton's first law expresses the property of inertia of matter. From Newton's first law of motion we observe that a body cannot change its state on its own. If the body is at rest, it tends to remain at rest forever and if it is in motion it tends to keep on motion with uniform speed for all time. This property of a body is termed as inertia.

Why is it easier to move a light object than a heavy one?,It is easier to move a light object because it has less inertia due to its smaller mass.,Explanatory,Easy,2024-10-26 07:02:11,"Here's why it's generally easier to move a light object than a heavy one:

**It's all about the force needed:**

* **Force and Mass:**  The amount of effort required to move an object is directly related to its mass (how much matter it contains) and the force applied. 
    * A heavy object requires more force because it has more mass to overcome. 
    * A light object only needs a smaller force to get moving, and once started moving requires less force to keep going.

**Here's a breakdown:**

1. **Friction:** Even with the same force applied to both objects, friction (the resistance to motion) can be more challenging on a heavy object. Friction is harder to overcome, making it feel like you need more force. 
2. **Inertia:** A heavier object has greater inertia (the natural tendency to resist change in motion). This means that it takes a bigger push or pull to get it moving and to keep it moving once started.

**Analogy:** Think of pushing a shopping cart versus a full-sized car. The shopping cart is light, so even with the same force, you can move it easily, while a car is much heavier; you need more power (strength) to push or pull it, even if it seems like an easy task.

What happens to passengers in a bus when it stops suddenly?,Passengers lean forwards due to inertia of motion.,Explanatory,Easy,2024-10-26 07:02:11,"This is an example of why inertia matters!  Passengers will be pushed forward by the bus as it comes to a stop. 

Here's a deeper explanation:

* **Newton's First Law:** This law states that an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will continue in motion at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
* **Inertia and Sudden Stops:** When the bus brakes suddenly, there is a strong change in its motion (the passengers were initially moving forward), which causes inertia to take effect.
* **Passenger Motion:** Because of their inertia, passengers are not able to stop immediately when the bus stops. They continue moving forward with the same speed as the bus until their bodies are stopped by friction and other forces.

Not only have the drivers, the passengers also had to wear the seat belt if there is an arrangement of seat belt in the car. We have a general concept about force from our daily life experiences. When we pull or push a body, then we say a force is applied upon the body. This applied force can create or tends to create motion in a stationary body. If the body is in motion, then the applied force can cease the motion of the body or tries to increase its velocity. In both cases to apply force, it needs direct contact between the force applier and the body. These types of force are known as contact force. If the two bodies are not in direct contact, still they can apply force on each other. Such a well-known force is the force of gravitation, whose practical example is the weight of a body. When a body falls from your hand, then it quickly touches the ground. What is the reason? It happens due to the weight or attraction of the earth on the body. We define this force as the force of gravitation. In this way we feel the existence of different type of forces in different events of nature. For example- the magnetic force between two poles of a magnet, the electrical force between two charged bodies, nuclear force within the nucleus.

Why do passengers wear seat belts while driving?,Passengers wear seat belts for safety to prevent injuries from sudden stops.,Explanatory,Easy,2024-10-26 07:02:11,"Seatbelts are crucial for safety in a car because they help to prevent injuries during sudden stops, crashes, and other unforeseen events. 

Here's why:

* **Inertia and Force:** When a vehicle suddenly brakes or swerves, the passengers inside experience inertia â€“ their bodies tend to continue moving forward at the same speed as before. Without seatbelts, this force can cause them to hit the dashboard, windshield, or even be thrown through the car's interior, resulting in serious injuries.
* **Controlled Movement:** Seatbelts restrain passengers by applying a controlled force to limit their movement during sudden stops. They pull on the passenger and keep them from being ejected from the vehicle, reducing the severity of impacts with the seat or dashboard. 
* **Increased Safety:** The impact absorption provided by a seat belt can be crucial in preventing serious injuries like broken bones, head trauma, and whiplash.


It's important to wear your seatbelt every time you get into a car â€“ it's one of the most effective safety measures available!

What is the effect of air resistance and friction on a moving bicycle?,Air resistance and friction cause the bicycle to slow down and eventually stop.,Explanatory,Easy,2024-10-26 07:02:11,"Here's how air resistance and friction affect a moving bicycle:

**Air Resistance:**

* **Slowing Down:** Air resistance, also known as drag, acts opposite to the motion of the bicycle. It increases as the bike travels faster. This means a bike will encounter more drag at higher speeds. 
* **Increased Effort:** Air resistance requires work from the cyclist to overcome, making pedaling more tiring and requiring more force. 
* **Reduced Efficiency:** The friction generated by air resistance slows down the bicycle's speed, reducing its efficiency and increasing energy consumption.

**Friction:**

* **Rolling Resistance:** This is friction between the tires and the road surface. It's generally constant regardless of speed but can increase slightly at higher speeds due to increased tire pressure.
* **Braking Friction:** When braking, friction between brake pads and wheels provides stopping power. The force required to stop increases with the weight and speed of the bicycle. 

**Combined Effects:**

* **Balancing Act:**  Air resistance and friction are constant factors that constantly interact and influence a bike's motion. 
* **Pedaling Power:** Riders need to balance their pedaling effort against these opposing forces for efficient and safe riding.

","Page Unknown: When a hard brake is applied on a car moving fast, the car does not stop rather cross a small distance by sliding.</p> <h2>Rolling Friction</h2> <p>Rolling friction is friction between a rolling object and the surface that it is rolling on. The wheel's motion of a cycle, motion of marble is example of rolling friction.</p> <p>During travelling we use luggage carrier having wheels to carry goods. If there was no wheel in the luggage carrier then it was too difficult to pull it by sliding from one place to another. Due to the attachment of wheel it becomes easier to pull it i.e. the force of rolling friction is less than that of the static friction.</p> <h2>Fluid Friction</h2> <p>When an object moves in a fluid i.e. a liquid or gas, the friction acts is called fluid friction.</p> <p>We have to overcome a barrier in water while swimming in the pond. This barrier is the fluid friction. A parachute works by harnessing the air resistance. The air resistance is a type of frictional force which works against the force of gravity of the earth. As an open parachute has a large surface area, it helps provide enough air resistance. As a result, the sky-diver's falling speed is decreased mostly. So, the skydiver will then be able to descend slowly and safely.</p> <h2>3.10 Effects Of Friction On Motion</h2> <p>Friction has enormous influence on the motion of an object.

The friction force between the tyres and the road depends on condition of the tyres and surface of the road. It also depends on the weight of the vehicle. The tyre's rubber surface is designed with treads i.e. grooves or teeth. The tyre surface is up and down due to these grooves. If the tyre is new, these grooves are distinct; as a result the force of friction between the tyre and the road is maximum. When the tyre becomes old, their grooves are worn out and the surface becomes flat. As a result the frictional force between the tyre and the road decreased mostly. Say, what inconvenience may arise due to this.</p> <h2>Smoothness Of Road</h2> <p>The smoothness of road has a great impact on the motion of a body. When the road is smooth, movement of vehicles on the road becomes easier and the journey becomes comfortable. "
What is the difference between a body at rest and a body in motion?,"A body at rest will remain at rest, while a body in motion will continue to move unless acted upon by an external force.",Explanatory,Easy,2024-10-26 07:02:11,"Here's a breakdown of the differences between a body at rest and a body in motion:

**Body at Rest:** 

* **Definition:** A body is considered at rest when it experiences no net force.  It means it doesn't change its velocity (speed or direction) or remain unchanged from a state of equilibrium.
* **Characteristics:**
    * No acceleration
    * Zero change in velocity over time
    * Constant position
    * Example: A book resting on a table, a statue in a museum


**Body in Motion:**

* **Definition:** A body is considered in motion when it is experiencing a net force (push or pull) causing it to accelerate. 
* **Characteristics:**
   *  Acceleration (change in velocity)
   * Constant change in its position over time
   * Example: A ball rolling on the ground, a moving car, you walking.


**Key Difference:**

The core difference is about force and acceleration. In motion, there is an interaction with forces that cause change in speed or direction.  In rest, there are no external forces to cause change.

What happens to the upper part of a passenger's body when a bus suddenly starts moving?,The upper part of the body tends to remain stationary due to inertia of rest.,Explanatory,Easy,2024-10-26 07:02:11,"When a bus suddenly starts moving, the passengers are subjected to inertia. This means their bodies tend to continue moving in the same direction they were traveling at that moment. 

The upper part of the passengers' bodies will naturally move forward with the bus, and this motion is governed by the law of inertia. However, when the bus suddenly starts moving, people's bodies are not equipped to immediately stop.  They experience a sudden change in their motion as the bus accelerates, which can result in injuries if they were not restrained.

For example:
* **Without seatbelts:** Passengers may move forward with an abrupt force, hit the dashboard, windshield or get thrown around inside the vehicle. 
* **With seat belts:**  The seatbelt acts like a restraining force to prevent passengers from being injured in a sudden stop. It slows them down and helps keep them secured.

When we pull or push a body, then we say a force is applied upon the body. This applied force can create or tends to create motion in a stationary body. If the body is in motion, then the applied force can cease the motion of the body or tries to increase its velocity. In both cases to apply force, it needs direct contact between the force applier and the body. These types of force are known as contact force. If the two bodies are not in direct contact, still they can apply force on each other. Such a well-known force is the force of gravitation, whose practical example is the weight of a body. When a body falls from your hand, then it quickly touches the ground. What is the reason? It happens due to the weight or attraction of the earth on the body. We define this force as the force of gravitation. In this way we feel the existence of different type of forces in different events of nature. For example- the magnetic force between two poles of a magnet, the electrical force between two charged bodies, nuclear force within the nucleus.

Why do heavy objects require more effort to move?,"Heavy objects have more mass and therefore more inertia, making them harder to move.",Explanatory,Easy,2024-10-26 07:02:11,"Here's the explanation of why heavy objects require more effort to move:

* **Increased Resistance:** Heavy objects have a greater mass, meaning they resist changes in motion (acceleration) more significantly. They create a higher force needed to overcome inertia, making them harder to push or pull. 
* **Greater Kinetic Energy:**  A heavier object has a greater kinetic energy, as its mass is large, this can make it take more work to get it moving.
* **Force-Mass Relationship:** Newton's Second Law of Motion (F=ma) tells us that the force needed to move an object is directly proportional to its mass and acceleration. The higher the mass, the greater the force required to produce a given change in velocity. 


**Think of it this way:**

Imagine pushing a grocery cart versus a full-size truck. The cart is light, so it requires less effort to push due to lower resistance (inertia). But the truck is heavy and takes more muscle power because of its higher mass and resistance to acceleration.  
","Page Unknown: For example, bull pulls the plough; a laborer pushes forward a push cart, someone throws iron sphere is sports competition etc.</p> <p>Let us consider the following examples: a) Ratan is standing still with a packet of book in his hand.</p> <p>b) Mita is pushing her physics book from one end to another of a table. c) Niru is lifting a heavy bag through stairs. d) Rimi is pushing the wall strongly.</p> <p>As work is said to be done only when a force is acted on a body and displaces it, so in the above examples (b) and (c) work is done but in the example (a) and (d) no work is done. We can apply force to shift a body from one place to another. We can change the shape of any body by applying force. In these cases work is done. If a construction laborer wants to get to the second floor of a building with ten bricks, he has to do more work than that of lifting a single brick to the same place as he has to use more force. He has to do more work if he wants to lift those brick on the third floor. Therefore, the amount of work depends on the applied force and the distance. Work is measured by the product of applied force on a body and its displacement along the direction of force.

Page Unknown: This resistive force is called frictional force.</p> <p>The frictional force always acts opposite to the motion and obstructs the motion.</p> <h2>Origin Of Friction</h2> <p>Whenever the surface of an object slides over the surface of another object, each object exerts a frictional force on the other. The question arises- why friction occur? Friction is the result of the surface irregularities of any two surfaces. Each object has a surface. Again, the surface may be smooth or rough. Apparently, the surface of an object seems to be smooth, but it is observed that there are high and low grooves on it when viewed by a microscope [Figure 3.8]. When an object moves on another object, then the grooves of the two surfaces in contact catch onto one another. As a result of which the motion of one surface over another surface gets obstacled.</p> <p>As the grooves of a surface deepend and their number increases i.e. as the surface become rougher, the motion of one surface over another becomes more obstructed. Then the magnitude of frictional force also increases. The body becomes mobile if it can overcome the resistance of the surface in contact. "
