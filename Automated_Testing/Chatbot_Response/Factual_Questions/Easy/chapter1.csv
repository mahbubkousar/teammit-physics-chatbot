Who is considered the father of experimental scientific methods?,Roger Bacon**,Factual,Easy,,"According to the text provided, **Roger Bacon** is considered the pioneer of the experimental scientific methods. 
","Page Unknown: Snell (15911626 A.D) of Germany discovered the laws of refraction of light. Huygen (1626-1695 A.D) reviewed the motion of pendulum, developed the mechanical device of clocks and invented the wave theory of light. Robert Hook (1635-1703 A.D) strove to find out the elastic properties of bodies. Robert Boyle (1627-1691 A.D) conducted experiments to find out the properties of gases at different pressures. Von Guerick (1602-1686 A.D) invented air pump. Romer (1644-1710 A.D) measured the velocity of light by studying the eclipse of a satellite of Jupiter, but none of his contemporary scientist believed that velocity of light could be so high. Kepler (1571-1630 A.D) presented three laws for a general mathematical explanation of concept of solar-centered theory of Copernicus. Kepler's success was based on his assumption of an elliptical orbit opposed to the conventional circular orbit. He verified the validity of his mathematical laws about the orbits of the planets with the data collected through observation by his teacher Tychobrahe (1546-1601 A.D). The inception of modern scientific method was made by a famous Italian scientist Galileo (1564-1642 A.D). He showed for the first time that the observations, experimentations and definitions of physical quantities systematically and the determination of relations among them are the basic foundation of scientific works.</p> <p>Galileo introduced the scientific trends of developing mathematical theory and verifying its authenticity through experiment. Later, Newton (1642-1727 A.D) gave it a complete shape.

Page Unknown: During this time the contribution of Ibne-Al-Haithan (965-1039 A.D) and Al-Hazen (965-1038 A.D) may be particularly mentioned for their theories of light, a branch of physics. Ptolemy (127-151 A.D) and other earlier scientists believed that the eyes itself sends light rays to see an object. Al-Hazen contradicted this view and asserted that we see an object because light rays from the object fall on our eyes. Experiments with magnifying glass brought him near to the modern theory of convex lens. Al-Masudi (896-956 A.D) wrote an encyclopedia on the History of Nature in which the name of Windmill was first mentioned. At present many countries of the world produce electricity by using this windmill. Roger Bacon (1214-1294 A.D) was the pioneer of the experimental scientific methods. According to him all scientific truths should be verified through observations and experiments. At the end of the fifteenth century, Leonardo de Vinci (1452-1519 A.D) made a model of aero plane by observing the act of flying of birds. Although he was a painter, he had considerable knowledge about mechanics. As a result, he was able to invent efficiently some common instruments. During the Galileo-Newtonian age and even before that time a few of very important scientists, although small in number were born. They contributed a lot to the advancement of science too. Dr. Gilbert (1540-1603 A.D) is unforgettable for his extensive research and theory on magnetism. "

","Page Unknown: By the end of nineteenth century Roentgen (1845-1923 A.D) discovered x-rays and Becquerel (1852-1908 A.D) discovered the radio activity of uranium.</p> <p>In the twentieth century surprising advancement took place in the field of physics. Max Planck (1858-1947 A.D) discovered quantum theory of radiation. Albert Einstein (18791955 A.D) invented theory of relativity. These two theories not only explained the previous experimental result but also made some predictions which were experimentally verified. Ernest Rutherford's (1871-1937 A.D) nuclear theory regarding atoms and Neill Bohr's (1885-1962 A.D) concept of electron layers in the hydrogen atoms were very important step of atomic physics.</p> <p>The next important discovery was made in 1938. At this time Otto Hann (1879-1968 A.D) and Stresemann (1902-1980 A.D) found out that nucleus was fissionable. Due to fission a nucleus of large mass number splits up into two nuclei of approximately equal mass number and a part of its mass is converted into energy as a result of which atom bomb and nuclear reactor are invented. The amount of energy we are getting at present from the nucleus is huge compared to the energy obtained from all the sources in the past. Day by day nuclear energy is becoming the principal source of energy. In this century quantum theory of the relativity etc. was developed in the field of theoretical physics. Satyendranath Basu (1894-1974 A.D) professor of physics, University of Dhaka made important contribution on theoretical physics.

Page Unknown: his hair. Before combing his hair he rubbed the comb with his woolen pullover for a while. While combing his hair he observed surprisingly that he cannot do it because all the hair was becoming straight and repels away each other. As soon as Sourov brings the comb close to the tale he observes the comb attracting some pieces of paper on the table. Some of you may have the same kind of experience like Sourov. In our daily life we observe that many objects around us behave like the comb of Sourov.</p> <p>Do it yourself: Rub your dry hair with your plastic scale for a while and hold it near some pieces of paper.</p> <p>We see that an object attracts another object in a special condition or becomes charged that is electricity produced in the object. Their charge remains static in the place of its production. So it is called static electricity. Now let us see what we mean by being charged.</p> <p>We know that each matter is consisted of small particles. The atom of every matter consists of electrons and which revolves around the nucleus. In the nucleus there are two type of particles-proton and neutron. The fundamental and special property of primary particles (electron and proton) of which the matter consist of is electrical property, which is determined by charge. The charges of electrons are negative and the charges of protons are considered to be positive. Neutron is electrically neutral that is it has no charge. The amount of charge in a proton is equal to the charge of an electron. Naturally an atom has an equal number of protons and electrons. As a result in the atom whole atom there is no electrical property to be detected. "

Page Unknown: The act of measuring something in our daily life is called measurement. In general, measurement means the act of determining the quantity of something. For example, the distance of the school from Rizu's home is 700 meters. Sohel has bought 5 Kilograms of rice from the shop. Rina takes 50 seconds to go to the school's office room. Here, 700 meters is the distance, 5 kilograms is the mass of rice and 50 seconds is the amount of time spent. We need two things to measure anything. One is number and another is unit. A standard is essential, comparing with which any measurement is done. These standard quantities are called the unit of measurement. Say, the length of a rod is 4 meters. Here, meter is a unit of length and 1 meter is a specific measurement. Therefore, length of the rod 4 meters means length of the rod is 4 times of this 1 meter's unit. There are different units for measurement of time, volume, velocity, mass, force, energy, temperature, electric current etc. These units have been designed in such way that they can be convenient and can be easily and accurately reproduced. Except some units all these units are interrelated with one another.</p> <h2>Fundamental Unit In Si</h2> <p>We can select fundamental units according to your liking, since the units of fundamental quantities do not depend on other units.

Page Unknown: The act of measuring something in our daily life is called measurement. In general, measurement means the act of determining the quantity of something. For example, the distance of the school from Rizu's home is 700 meters. Sohel has bought 5 Kilograms of rice from the shop. Rina takes 50 seconds to go to the school's office room. Here, 700 meters is the distance, 5 kilograms is the mass of rice and 50 seconds is the amount of time spent. We need two things to measure anything. One is number and another is unit. A standard is essential, comparing with which any measurement is done. These standard quantities are called the unit of measurement. Say, the length of a rod is 4 meters. Here, meter is a unit of length and 1 meter is a specific measurement. Therefore, length of the rod 4 meters means length of the rod is 4 times of this 1 meter's unit. There are different units for measurement of time, volume, velocity, mass, force, energy, temperature, electric current etc. These units have been designed in such way that they can be convenient and can be easily and accurately reproduced. Except some units all these units are interrelated with one another.</p> <h2>Fundamental Unit In Si</h2> <p>We can select fundamental units according to your liking, since the units of fundamental quantities do not depend on other units.

**Fundamental Quantities:**

* **Definition:** Fundamental quantities are those that cannot be expressed as a combination of other physical quantities. They represent basic units from which all other measurements are built. 
* **Examples:** Length, Mass, Time, Electric current, Temperature (Kelvin). These form the foundation for describing physical phenomena in the universe.
* **Why they're important:**  Fundamental quantities are essential because they directly relate to the fundamental laws of physics, and every measurement made in science relies on them.

**Derived Quantities:** 

* **Definition:** Derived quantities are combinations or calculations that are produced using fundamental quantities. 
* **Examples:** Velocity (distance / time), Acceleration (change in velocity / time), Force (mass x acceleration), Energy (work = force x distance). 
* **Why they're important:**  Derived quantities provide a specific way to express physical relationships, making it easier to understand and analyze complex systems.


**Analogy:**

Imagine building with Legos: 

* **Fundamental Quantities:** These are your basic Lego pieces - the blocks themselves (length, mass). They are essential but don't represent anything in particular on their own.
* **Derived Quantities:**  You use these fundamental pieces to create complex structures (velocity = distance / time) or machines (force x acceleration = impulse)

Here the symbol ± means that the real length of the book is between 25.9cm and 26.1cm. Here 0.1cm is the uncertainty or error of measurement. Generally there are three types of error in measurement. There are : a) Random error b) Instrumental error c) Personal error a) Random error : The error for which irrelevant occur in measured results by measuring a constant quantities. Several times is random error. The word random itself implies that the error cannot be guessed earlier and expected value will be zero. This is because measured values moves around the accurate value and average value of the errors should be zero if the value of the quantity is measured by the same instrument. The random error will be included as much as many time the scale is used to measure the floor. Each time the front edge marking on the floor falls a little back and forth of the accurate mark.

Page Unknown: The act of measuring something in our daily life is called measurement. In general, measurement means the act of determining the quantity of something. For example, the distance of the school from Rizu's home is 700 meters. Sohel has bought 5 Kilograms of rice from the shop. Rina takes 50 seconds to go to the school's office room. Here, 700 meters is the distance, 5 kilograms is the mass of rice and 50 seconds is the amount of time spent. We need two things to measure anything. One is number and another is unit. A standard is essential, comparing with which any measurement is done. These standard quantities are called the unit of measurement. Say, the length of a rod is 4 meters. Here, meter is a unit of length and 1 meter is a specific measurement. Therefore, length of the rod 4 meters means length of the rod is 4 times of this 1 meter's unit. There are different units for measurement of time, volume, velocity, mass, force, energy, temperature, electric current etc. These units have been designed in such way that they can be convenient and can be easily and accurately reproduced. Except some units all these units are interrelated with one another.</p> <h2>Fundamental Unit In Si</h2> <p>We can select fundamental units according to your liking, since the units of fundamental quantities do not depend on other units. But our selection must have international recognition. It should have some characteristics as well. For example, it should be unchangeable, that is, independent of place, time and person. It will not change due to passage of time or any other natural change. It could be reproduced easily. "

What is the definition of space in physics?,A three-dimensional extension with no beginning or end**,Factual,Easy,,"In physics, ""space"" has a couple of important meanings. It's not just about empty emptiness. Here are the key ideas:

**1.  The Four-Dimensional Universe:** 

* **Classical Space (3 Dimensions):** This is the familiar space we experience - length, width, and height (often called Euclidean Space).
* **Spacetime (4 Dimensions):**  Einstein's theory of relativity showed us that space and time are intertwined in a four-dimensional fabric. We call this ""spacetime"". 

   * This extra dimension is what allows gravity to work! It's how massive objects warp the fabric of spacetime, which influences how objects move within it.

**2.  Space as Mathematical Structure:**
    * **Vector Spaces:** In mathematics and physics, we often use abstract spaces to describe things that exist in different dimensions (think about moving particles or even light waves). These spaces are defined by mathematical rules.

What is the definition of time in physics?,A measure of the duration of events**,Factual,Easy,,"The way we think about ""time"" in physics has a lot of complexities. Here are some key concepts: 

* **Time as an Arrow:** We often experience time as a unidirectional arrow, moving from past to future. This idea is embedded in how our brains perceive the world and is supported by everyday observations.  
* **Relativity's Revolution:** Einstein's theory of relativity changed how we think about time by showing that it isn't absolute but relative. It depends on your speed and gravitational field! 
    * **Spacetime Fabric:** Time is intertwined with space in spacetime. Imagine a trampoline, where massive objects (like planets) create dips or ""curves"". This warp changes the motion of nearby objects. This warping of time is what causes things to slow down near strong gravity.

**More Specifically:**

* **Special Relativity:**
   * Time slows down for objects that are moving very fast relative to a stationary observer. 
    * The faster an object moves, the slower its clock ticks compared to a stationary observer.
* **General Relativity:**  
    * Gravity itself is not just a force, it's a warp of spacetime caused by mass and energy.  This warping is what we perceive as gravity.

**Key Takeaways:** 

* Time isn't ""real"" in the same way that space is. It's a concept we use to organize events and understand changes in the universe.
* Our experience of time is shaped by how our brains process information, but it can also be distorted by gravity or moving at high speeds.

* **Units and Measurement:**  Each dimension comes equipped with a unit system to measure it. For example, length is measured in meters, while time is measured in seconds. 

* **Fundamental Concepts of Physics:** Dimensions are fundamental to the study of:
    * **Relativity:** Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space and time by introducing spacetime as a unified entity.
    * **Quantum Mechanics:** Quantum mechanics operates in multi-dimensional spaces, where particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously.

What is the definition of a scientific notation?,A way of expressing numbers as the product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10**,Factual,Easy,,"Scientific notation is a way to express very large or very small numbers in a compact and easy-to-read form. It's done by writing a number as a product of a coefficient (a decimal between 1 and 10) multiplied by a power of ten.

**Here's the general structure:**

* **Coefficient:** This is a single digit or decimal number between 1 and 10, plus possibly an optional trailing zero if you are expressing the result of a scientific experiment to make it more convenient to work with.
* **Exponent:** This indicates how many times the coefficient is multiplied by ten (e.g., 1.2 x 10⁴ represents 1.2 times 10 raised to the power of 4).

**Example:**  The number 7,896,000 can be written in scientific notation as **7.896 x 10⁶**. This is simply writing the coefficient (7.896) and the exponent (6) together.

","Page Unknown: As for example, 6733000000 are 6.733 x 108 and 0.00000846 is 8.46 x 106. So it is seen that the original number is obtained from a number expressed in notation by placing the decimal point to the right by the number of digits equal to the power of 10 if the power is positive and to the left if the power is negative. In the case of numbers expressed in scientific notation the following general rule of multiplication is applicable : 10m x 10ª = 10m+n Here, m and n may be any positive or negative number. For example, 106 x 10' = 1013, 107 x 10-20 = 10-13 In case of division the following rule is applicable : 10"" 10m = 10""= 10""= 10"" = 10"" "" For example, 106 + 104 = 102 or 103 + 107 = 10 3(-7) = 1010</p> <h2>1.6 Dimensions :</h2> <p>By now, we know that a physical quantity is a combination of one or more fundamental quantities.

","Page Unknown: Only for important purposes line-break may be acceptable.</p> </li> </ol> <h2>1.8 Measuring Instruments : Meter Scale :</h2> <p>This simplest instrument to measure length in the laboratory is a meter scale. It's length is 1 meter or 100 centimeters. This is why, it is called a meter scale. One side of this scale is graduated in centimeter and the other side in inches. Each centimeter is divided into ten equal parts. Each of this parts is called 1 millimeter or 0.1 centimeter. Each inch is divided into eight, ten or sixteen equal parts.</p> <p>Measure with a meter scale : To measure the length of a rod or a stick by the meter scale, it's one end is so placed that is coincides with the 0 mark or some other convenient mark of the scale. The reading of the mark that coincides with the other end of the rod is taken. The difference between the readings at the two ends of the rod gives the length of the rod. In general if the reading of the mark that coincides with the left end of the rod is x and that of the mark coinciding with the right end is y. Then the length of the rod is L = y - x. With this scale length may be measured to an accuracy of 1 millimeter. For more accurate measurement vernier scales are used.</p> <h2>Vernier Scale :</h2> <p>In the ordinary meter scale we can measured length up to 1 millimeter. 
---
Page Unknown: This length will be the vernier reading.</p> <p>Now it is to be noted which vernier scale mark coincides with which of the main scale mark. If no vernier mark coincide with a main scale mark then find out the nearest vernier mark. The reading of this mark that is the number of vernier scale divisions from the left to this mark, is the vernier scale reading.</p> <p>Suppose the Vth vernier mark coincides with or nearest with any main scale mark. Hence the vernier constant of the instrument is VC. The length of the rod = main scale reading + vernier scale reading = main scale reading + vernier scale reding x vernier scale constant.</p> <p>Thus, L = M + V x VC, where VC is the vernier constant.</p> <p>Example : Suppose, the end B of the rod has crossed 12mm mark of the main scale and 7th vernier mark has coincide with a main scale mark. Then the length of the rod will be L = 12mm + 7 x 0.1mm (here vernier constant is 0.1mm) = 12.7mm = 1.27cm.</p> <p>The jaw connected with the vernier scale is to be pushed forward so that the jaws of the main scale and the vernier scale touch the opposite ends of the object. In some instrument reading not be coincided. "
What is the definition of a vernier constant?,The difference between the smallest division of the main scale and the vernier scale division**,Factual,Easy,,"The vernier constant is a specific measurement value that accounts for the discrepancies between the actual measured length of an object and the reading on a scale. 

It's important to understand the following:

* **Vernier Caliper:** This tool works by having two scales (the main scale and a vernier scale) which are used together to read out measurements.
* **Discrepancies:** The vernier scale provides finer adjustments to the measurement because it has a series of graduations that help us get closer to an accurate reading.


**How Vernier Constant Works:**

The vernier constant is defined as the difference between the main scale reading and the vernier scale reading for any given measurement, usually expressed as a ratio.  This ratio represents the accuracy of the instrument because it's how much the vernier scale needs to be adjusted in order to get a more precise reading than just using the main scale. 


Let me know if you have any other questions! 😊  
","Page Unknown: A simple equation may be used to determine the vernier constant, that is vernier constant = s/n, where s is the length of 1 smallest division of the main scale and n the number of vernier divisions.</p> <p>As mentioned above, s = 1 mm and n = 10 divisions :. Vernier constant = s / n = 1mm / 10 = 0.1mm = 0.01cm.</p> <p>Sometimes 20 vernier scale divisions are equal to 19 smallest main scale divisions and the smallest main scale division is less than 1mm. Then the vernier constant becomes difference. The vernier constant depends on the characteristics of marking the main scale and the vernier scale.</p> <h2>Slide Calipers :</h2> <p>The other name of slide calipers is venire calipers. Because the Venire's method is used for the measurement with this instrument. The main scale of the slide calipers is made of a graduated rectangular still plate. A metal jaw is fixed at the starting end of the main scale, that is, at the end marked 0 of the main scale. A Jawed small scale is put over the body of the main scale, to measure fraction of the small division of the main scale accurately.

Page Unknown: To measure fractions of millimeter like 0.2mm, 0.6mm, 0.8mm etc. we have to use vernier scale.</p> <p>This scale was invented by a mathematician Pierea Vernier and is called vernier scale according to his name.</p> <p><img alt=""18_image_0.png"" src=""18_image_0.png"" /></p> <p>Fig.1.1 Vernier Scale A small scale is used by the side of the main scale for accurate measurement of fractions of the smallest division of the main scale. By using vernier scale along with meter scale fractions of millimeter may be measured accurately. Vernier scale can be moved forward or backward along the side of the main scale. Say, a vernier scale has ten divisions, this ten division is equal to nine smallest divisions of the main scale (fig 1.1). Nine smallest divisions of main scale is 9 millimeter or 0.9 centimeter. As 10 vernier scale divisions is equal to nine smallest divisions of the main scale. So, a vernier scale division is slightly smaller than the smallest division of the main scale. The difference between the smallest main scale division and the vernier scale division is called vernier constant. It is generally written by VC. "

What is the name of the scientist who developed the concept of quantum mechanics?,Not mentioned in the chapter**,Factual,Easy,,"The scientists most closely associated with developing the concept of quantum mechanics are **Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and Erwin Schrödinger.** 

Here's a brief breakdown: 

* **Max Planck:**  First proposed the quantized nature of energy (e.g., photons).
* **Albert Einstein:**  Developed the theory of relativity and showed that light has both wave-like and particle-like properties.
* **Niels Bohr:** Introduced the concept of atomic orbits and explained how electrons occupy specific energy levels in an atom.
* **Werner Heisenberg:** Developed the matrix mechanics, which provided a framework for understanding quantum uncertainty. 
* **Erwin Schrödinger:** Formulated the Schrödinger equation, which describes the behavior of atoms and molecules at the quantum level.


The development of quantum mechanics was a collaborative effort that involved many brilliant minds working together over several decades. It revolutionized our understanding of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels! 
","Page Unknown: By the end of nineteenth century Roentgen (1845-1923 A.D) discovered x-rays and Becquerel (1852-1908 A.D) discovered the radio activity of uranium.</p> <p>In the twentieth century surprising advancement took place in the field of physics. Max Planck (1858-1947 A.D) discovered quantum theory of radiation. Albert Einstein (18791955 A.D) invented theory of relativity. These two theories not only explained the previous experimental result but also made some predictions which were experimentally verified. Ernest Rutherford's (1871-1937 A.D) nuclear theory regarding atoms and Neill Bohr's (1885-1962 A.D) concept of electron layers in the hydrogen atoms were very important step of atomic physics.</p> <p>The next important discovery was made in 1938. At this time Otto Hann (1879-1968 A.D) and Stresemann (1902-1980 A.D) found out that nucleus was fissionable. Due to fission a nucleus of large mass number splits up into two nuclei of approximately equal mass number and a part of its mass is converted into energy as a result of which atom bomb and nuclear reactor are invented. The amount of energy we are getting at present from the nucleus is huge compared to the energy obtained from all the sources in the past. Day by day nuclear energy is becoming the principal source of energy. In this century quantum theory of the relativity etc. was developed in the field of theoretical physics. Satyendranath Basu (1894-1974 A.D) professor of physics, University of Dhaka made important contribution on theoretical physics.

Page Unknown: He demonstrated a comparatively correct form of Planck's quantum theory. His theory is known as Bose-Einstein's statistics. As recognition of his contribution one kind of elementary particle is named after him and is called Boson. Three nobel laureate physicist Prof. Abdus Salam (19261996 A.D) of Pakistan, Sheldon Glasso (1932-) and Stevan Wienberg (1933-) of United States made outstanding contribution by discovering weak electric force in unifying the elementary particles in unified field theory. Prior to that nobel laureate physicist Chandra Shekhar Ramon (1888-1970 A.D) discovered Ramon effect. Physics has made significant contribution in the progress of medical science in twentieth century. By using radio isotopes along with the discovery of numerous equipments physics has contributed to medical science. Another advancement of physics in twentieth century is exploration in the space. The contribution of physics lies in landing human footprint on the moon along with the staying of months after months in space station and exploration on the Mars. Artificial satellite has contributed to forecast weather and made communication easy. Moreover electronics has already brought about revolution in our daily life and changed our life style. Now a days radio, television, digital camera, mobile phone, i-pad and computer are used almost in every house. Various electronics instruments have developed human's work ability to a great extent. In nineteenth century physics played a vital role for the advancement of medical science.</p> <p>Outstanding contribution of physics in the field of medical science lies in inventing different instrument along with radio isotope for the prevention of diseases.

What is the definition of a physical quantity that can be measured?,Anything that can be measured in the physical world**,Factual,Easy,,"A **physical quantity** that can be measured is one whose value can be objectively determined using a device or instrument. 


Here's why it's important to distinguish between what can be measured and a concept like ""time"":

* **Measurable:**  Think of physical quantities like mass, length, time, temperature. These are things you can actually *measure*, giving you an objective value.
* **Concepts/Ideas:** Concepts like ""justice,"" or ""happiness"" are not measurable in the same way as height or weight. They describe states of being or feelings but don't have a concrete numerical value that can be directly measured.  


Let me know if you'd like more clarification or examples! 😊 
","Page Unknown: For example, the length of a table can be measured. Here, length is a physical quantity. The mass of your body can be measured, mass is a physical quantity. The time during which you are reading this book can be measured, time is a physical quantity. If you apply force to lift some thing, that force can be measured. So force is a physical quantity. There are many such quantities in this physical world. Among these, it is seen that there are a few quantities which can be measured without any help from any other quantities. These quantities are `fundamental quantities'. For instance, to measure the length of a table, you need to measure only the length. To measure this length, there is no need of measuring any other quantity. So, length is a fundamental quantity. On the other hand, measurement of some quantities need the help of other quantities. For example, to measure the density of copper bar it is necessary to measure the mass and volume of a piece of copper bar and then mass is to be divided by the volume. Again, to measure the volume, the length, the breadth and the height are to be measured, that is, lengths are to be measured three times in three directions. So, it is seen that, there are certain quantities which are fundamental. They do not depend on other quantities. These are called fundamental quantities. So, the physical quantities which are independent or neutral that is, they do not depend on other quantity, rather other quantities depend on them, are called fundamental quantities. Scientists have identified seven such quantities as fundamental quantities which are used in all branches of science for measurement.

Page Unknown: The act of measuring something in our daily life is called measurement. In general, measurement means the act of determining the quantity of something. For example, the distance of the school from Rizu's home is 700 meters. Sohel has bought 5 Kilograms of rice from the shop. Rina takes 50 seconds to go to the school's office room. Here, 700 meters is the distance, 5 kilograms is the mass of rice and 50 seconds is the amount of time spent. We need two things to measure anything. One is number and another is unit. A standard is essential, comparing with which any measurement is done. These standard quantities are called the unit of measurement. Say, the length of a rod is 4 meters. Here, meter is a unit of length and 1 meter is a specific measurement. Therefore, length of the rod 4 meters means length of the rod is 4 times of this 1 meter's unit. There are different units for measurement of time, volume, velocity, mass, force, energy, temperature, electric current etc. These units have been designed in such way that they can be convenient and can be easily and accurately reproduced. Except some units all these units are interrelated with one another.</p> <h2>Fundamental Unit In Si</h2> <p>We can select fundamental units according to your liking, since the units of fundamental quantities do not depend on other units. But our selection must have international recognition. It should have some characteristics as well. For example, it should be unchangeable, that is, independent of place, time and person. It will not change due to passage of time or any other natural change. It could be reproduced easily. "
