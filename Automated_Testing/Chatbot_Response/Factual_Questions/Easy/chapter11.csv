Cross connection may be occurred in analogue device but it cannot be happened in digital system.</p> <h2>13.8. Semiconductor And Integrated Circuit</h2> <p>Semiconductor: There are some materials (such as- silicon and germanium) which are neither good conductor nor insulator. These are called semiconductors. Pure semiconductor works as an insulator when it is cold. At normal room temperature it behaves slightly as a conductor. But the conductivity of semiconductor can be increased by adding some definite elements with it. Semiconductor is divided into n-type and ptype on the basis of the elements added to it. Negative and positive charge carriers are denoted by n-type and p-type respectively. The semiconductor made by the addition of phosphorous with silicon is an example of n-type material. The presence of phosphorous atoms increases the number of negatively charged electrons which can move freely in the substance. The semiconductor made by the addition of boron with silicon is the example of p-type material. The boron atoms create gap or positive holes in the electronic structure of atom. The electrons move from one hole to another by jumping within the material.

","Page Unknown: Solid materials are classified into three groups depending on their electricity conduction. For example: (1) conductor (2) insulator (3) semiconductor.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Conductor: The materials through which electric current can flow very easily are called conductors. Electrons can flow freely within these materials. In metal wires the charges are carried by electrons. So, the metallic materials are good conductors of electricity. Copper, silver, aluminium etc. are good conductors. Due to this reason, metallic wires are used as electric connectors. 2. Insulator: The materials through which electric current cannot flow are called insulators. Therefore, the materials where electrons are not free to move about are the insulators. For example: Plastic, rubber, wood, glass etc. There are no free electrons inside insulating materials. Electrons do not flow easily through plastic type materials. As a result plastics are insulator for electricity. Due to this, the handles of screwdrivers and pliers used by electricians are covered with plastic type materials.

Cross connection may be occurred in analogue device but it cannot be happened in digital system.</p> <h2>13.8. Semiconductor And Integrated Circuit</h2> <p>Semiconductor: There are some materials (such as- silicon and germanium) which are neither good conductor nor insulator. These are called semiconductors. Pure semiconductor works as an insulator when it is cold. At normal room temperature it behaves slightly as a conductor. But the conductivity of semiconductor can be increased by adding some definite elements with it. Semiconductor is divided into n-type and ptype on the basis of the elements added to it. Negative and positive charge carriers are denoted by n-type and p-type respectively. The semiconductor made by the addition of phosphorous with silicon is an example of n-type material. The presence of phosphorous atoms increases the number of negatively charged electrons which can move freely in the substance. The semiconductor made by the addition of boron with silicon is the example of p-type material. The boron atoms create gap or positive holes in the electronic structure of atom. The electrons move from one hole to another by jumping within the material. If an n-type material is sandwiched with a p-type material, a very necessary device is developed which is called a p-n junction diode. It works as a rectifier.

* **Current Dissipation:** Earthing provides a low-resistance path for electrical currents, preventing them from accumulating in appliances and potentially causing damage. This is particularly important for sensitive electronic components.
* **Protection against Electrostatic Discharge (ESD):**  Earthing helps dissipate static electricity that might accumulate on the appliance due to handling or environmental conditions, preventing potential damage or malfunctions.

What is the purpose of a fuse?,To prevent excessive current flow in a circuit.,Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 10:05,"A fuse works similarly to a circuit breaker but has a more limited ability to handle overload situations. Here's how it functions:

* **Safety & Protection:**  When current in a circuit exceeds the fuse's rated value, the fuse blows or melts its internal filament. This breaks the connection and cuts off power flow.
* **Preventing Damage:** By interrupting the circuit when current becomes excessive, a fuse prevents potential damage to appliances, wires, and even hazards like electric shock for people.

Think of it as a sacrificial safety device: It protects valuable circuits from being overloaded or damaged by protecting them from excessive electrical current flow with its melting filament.

Why is it necessary to switch off the mains of electricity supply before changing a fuse?,To prevent electric shock.,Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 10:05,"It's crucial to switch off the main power supply (at the breaker box or fuse box) before changing a fuse because **electricity remains live even when an appliance is switched off**. 

Here's why it's dangerous to work on electrical circuits with electricity still flowing:

* **Electrocution Risk:**  You could come into contact with live wires and receive a severe electric shock. This can be fatal or cause serious injury.
* **Equipment Damage:** Touching live parts of an appliance without disengaging the power supply can damage them. 
* **Fire Hazard:** Faulty wiring or a malfunctioning device might still pose a fire risk even when seemingly inactive.

Therefore the electromotive force of the source W is, E = Q Unit: The SI unit of electromotive force is JC-1 or volt (V). The devices which can transform some other forms of energy into electrical energy they only have electromotive force. For example: cell, generator, etc. An electric cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy and a generator coverts mechanical energy into electrical energy. The electromotive force of a cell is the sum of the potential differences which develops in different parts of the circuit along with the cell.</p> <h2>Potential Difference:</h2> <p>The electricity flows through a conductor due to the potential difference between the two terminals. The potential difference between any two points is defined as the amount of work done to carry unit positive charge from one point to another of a circuit. When a dry cell is used in a torch, the electrical energy provided by the dry cell is converted into light and heat energy. The conservation of energy is maintained in this process of transformation of energy. The amount of energy converted across the light bulb for migration of unit positive charge is the potential difference between the two terminals of the bulb.

","Page Unknown: Solid materials are classified into three groups depending on their electricity conduction. For example: (1) conductor (2) insulator (3) semiconductor.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Conductor: The materials through which electric current can flow very easily are called conductors. Electrons can flow freely within these materials. In metal wires the charges are carried by electrons. So, the metallic materials are good conductors of electricity. Copper, silver, aluminium etc. are good conductors. Due to this reason, metallic wires are used as electric connectors. 2. Insulator: The materials through which electric current cannot flow are called insulators. Therefore, the materials where electrons are not free to move about are the insulators. For example: Plastic, rubber, wood, glass etc. There are no free electrons inside insulating materials. Electrons do not flow easily through plastic type materials. As a result plastics are insulator for electricity. Due to this, the handles of screwdrivers and pliers used by electricians are covered with plastic type materials. In addition, the copper wires which we use in our daily needs are covered with plastic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Semiconductor: The materials whose current conduction capacity lies between that of conductors and insulators in normal temperature are called semiconductors.
