Page Unknown: By the end of nineteenth century Roentgen (1845-1923 A.D) discovered x-rays and Becquerel (1852-1908 A.D) discovered the radio activity of uranium.</p> <p>In the twentieth century surprising advancement took place in the field of physics. Max Planck (1858-1947 A.D) discovered quantum theory of radiation. Albert Einstein (18791955 A.D) invented theory of relativity. These two theories not only explained the previous experimental result but also made some predictions which were experimentally verified. Ernest Rutherford's (1871-1937 A.D) nuclear theory regarding atoms and Neill Bohr's (1885-1962 A.D) concept of electron layers in the hydrogen atoms were very important step of atomic physics.</p> <p>The next important discovery was made in 1938. At this time Otto Hann (1879-1968 A.D) and Stresemann (1902-1980 A.D) found out that nucleus was fissionable. Due to fission a nucleus of large mass number splits up into two nuclei of approximately equal mass number and a part of its mass is converted into energy as a result of which atom bomb and nuclear reactor are invented. The amount of energy we are getting at present from the nucleus is huge compared to the energy obtained from all the sources in the past. Day by day nuclear energy is becoming the principal source of energy. In this century quantum theory of the relativity etc. was developed in the field of theoretical physics. Satyendranath Basu (1894-1974 A.D) professor of physics, University of Dhaka made important contribution on theoretical physics. "

Page Unknown: Here, uranium is made to react with a neutron of particular amount of energy. This reaction takes place in a nuclear reactor.</p> <p>In nuclear reaction usually matter that is mass is transformed into energy.

Since nuclear fission is a chain reaction, hence in a moment crores of reactions take place and huge amount of energy is released.</p> <p>Calculate: If a substance of 1kg mass is converted completely into energy, then how many kilowatt energy will be produced? 1 kilowatt-hour (1 kWh) = 3.6 x 10° J The energy obtained from this reaction can be transferred to another container as the internal energy of carbon dioxide, by pumping continuously at high pressure in a controlled way. This heated gas moves around a special steam boiler and heats the steam inside which can rotate a turbine and produce electricity. "

Page Unknown: To make the equipment germless, to control the thickness of paper in the paper mill, to identify the presence of smoke in the fire, to verify the welding of metals, the radioactivity is being successfully used. It is also used to measure the quantity of different elements in the minerals. Even the radioactive tracers are being used successfully to diagnose diseases.</p> <p>The hands and number of many watches are seen glittering even in the dark. This happens because the hands and the numbers in the watches are covered with a mixture of radioactive thorium and zinc sulfide, as a result they glitter. Radioactivity is also used to determine the age or time of things of millions year old.</p> <p>13.5: Dangers of radioactivity: Although radioactivity is beneficial to us, it can be very dangerous also. The high dose of radioactive radiation can create serious problems in human body. Life killer cancer may cause from this radiation. The preventive power against disease is reduced if someone keeps oneself in close-contact with excessive radioactive radiation for a long time.

What is the mass of an alpha particle compared to a hydrogen atom?,Four times.,Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 10:09,"Here's the answer and some explanation:

An alpha particle has **much more mass** than a hydrogen atom. 

* **Alpha particles:** Consists of two protons and two neutrons, meaning they have approximately 4 atomic mass units (amu).  
* **Hydrogen atoms:** Have only one proton and no neutrons, so their atomic mass is 1 amu.

The alpha particle's size and mass stem from its composition: a helium nucleus (two protons + two neutrons) compared to the single proton in a hydrogen atom.

What is the half-life of a radioactive element?,The time during which half of the total number of radioactive atoms undergoes disintegration.,Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 10:09,"The half-life of a radioactive element is the time it takes for **half** of the original sample to decay into its daughter products.

* **Radioactive decay:**  Atomic nuclei spontaneously transform over time, emitting radiation and transforming into different elements. 
* **Half-life:** This refers to the specific period during which half of the radioactive material undergoes this transformation.


It's important to note that every radioactive element has its own unique half-life, which can range from milliseconds (for some isotopes) to billions of years (for others).  Some examples include:

* **Carbon-14:** Half-life of about 5,730 years
* **Uranium-238:** Half-life of about 4.5 billion years

**The invention of the vacuum tube is generally credited to ** **John Ambrose Fleming** in 1904.** He developed the first practical vacuum tube, which he called an ""electron valve"". This was a crucial step towards the development of modern electronics.
","Page Unknown: The control of electric current through vacuum tube, special type of crystals and chips is known as electronics. The history of electronics is ancient of more than hundred years. The real journey of electronics begins with the invention of Addison's effect in 1883. When Addison was working with electric lamp, one thing was disturbing him highly. The positive end of the filament of carbon of the lamp was burning again and again. To remove this difficulty, he entered a plate by sealing it with the filament. He saw that when a positive potential is given to the plate with respect to the filament, an electric current flows through the vacuum tube. But when a negative potential is applied to the plate electric current does not flow. Addison explains this phenomenon in this way- as the emitted charge from the hot filament goes to the positive plate, so this charge is negative. If the plate is negative, it repels the emitted charge, as a result no current flows through the circuit. This is known as Addison effect. British physicist Fleming first invented the vacuum tube by using Addison effect. This tube works as a rectifier that means it changes alternating current to direct current. This is the real beginning of electronics. During this time, detector was very necessary for Marconi's Radio. This tube fills up the need of the detector. As there were two electrodes in it, this is called diode. After two years, an American named Lee de Forest invented another vacuum tube called triode.

What is the main use of semiconductors?,To control the flow of electric current.,Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 10:09,"The main use of semiconductors is in electronic devices like computers, smartphones, and solar panels. 

Here's why:

* **Transistors:** Semiconductors allow for the creation of transistors, which act as the building blocks of microchips and all other types of electronics.  
* **Controlling Electrical Flow:**  Semiconductors can control the flow of electricity in a way that regular conductors cannot. They are essential to switching, amplification, and data processing in electronic devices.

","Page Unknown: Though the digital device is more expensive than the analogue device, the total cost is less in digital system than that of the analogue system. Cross connection may be occurred in analogue device but it cannot be happened in digital system.</p> <h2>13.8. Semiconductor And Integrated Circuit</h2> <p>Semiconductor: There are some materials (such as- silicon and germanium) which are neither good conductor nor insulator. These are called semiconductors. Pure semiconductor works as an insulator when it is cold. At normal room temperature it behaves slightly as a conductor. But the conductivity of semiconductor can be increased by adding some definite elements with it. Semiconductor is divided into n-type and ptype on the basis of the elements added to it. Negative and positive charge carriers are denoted by n-type and p-type respectively. The semiconductor made by the addition of phosphorous with silicon is an example of n-type material. The presence of phosphorous atoms increases the number of negatively charged electrons which can move freely in the substance. The semiconductor made by the addition of boron with silicon is the example of p-type material. The boron atoms create gap or positive holes in the electronic structure of atom. The electrons move from one hole to another by jumping within the material. If an n-type material is sandwiched with a p-type material, a very necessary device is developed which is called a p-n junction diode. It works as a rectifier. Diode makes the electric current unidirectional i.e. the diode transforms the alternating current (AC) into a direct current (DC).

What is the difference between analogue and digital signals?,"Analogue signals are continuously changeable voltage or current, while digital signals are discrete values.",Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 10:09,"Here's a breakdown of the difference between analog and digital signals:

**Analog Signals:**

* **Continuous:** Analog signals represent information as continuous variations in amplitude. Imagine sound waves – they change smoothly over time, representing different frequencies and volumes. 
* **Representations:**  They use varying voltages or currents to represent data.
* **Examples:**  Radio waves, microphone signals, and the electrical signal from a speaker all fall under analog signal types.

**Digital Signals:**

* **Discrete:** Digital signals represent information as discrete values, usually represented by 0s and 1s. Think of binary code – it's essentially a pattern of on and off states.
* **Representations:**  They use only two levels of representation (often defined as true/false) for each data point. 
* **Examples:** Computers use digital signals to store and process information. The lights on your computer screen, the sound you hear from your speakers, even the data transmitted via the internet all rely on digital information.

**Key Differences Summarized:**

| Feature          | Analog Signal                     | Digital Signal                          |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Representation | Continuous variations            | Discrete values (0s and 1s)        |
| Levels           | Varies gradually                   |  Two distinct states (on/off, true/false)|


**In Simple Terms:**

Think of analog signals like a radio dial – you can tune to different frequencies to receive different stations. Digital signals are like computer code – the machine has specific instructions for understanding each ""1"" and ""0"". 
","Page Unknown: Analogue data is sent continuously.</p> <p>Telephone, radio, television broadcast and cable television generally send analogue data.</p> <p>So the analogue signals are continuously changeable voltage or current. This voltage or current is normally changed and can receive any value between the lowest and the highest value. Analogue signal is really a sine wave.

Analogue clock shows the time by continuous rotation of the hands and digital clock gives the time by changing the digits.</p> <h2>Advantages And Disadvantages Of Analogue And Digital Signal</h2> <p>Which one is better between analogue and digital signal can be measured by three factors. These are: the qualitative standard of the signal, the elements to maintain the process and cost or expense.</p> <p>Digital signal is the best to send a signal to a long distance. If the distance is long, the power of analogue signal decreases gradually. Then to sustain the analogue signal, amplification has to be done. As a result noise increases, and the quality of the signal is reduced or distorted and it can be fully lost. But the digital signal is amplified on the way. As a result the signal remains unchanged. Digital signal is used to transmit a signal through an optical fiber, since the qualitative standard of the last signal remains unchanged. Besides many signal can be sent in every second. "

2. **Antenna Reception:** The antenna of your radio picks up these radio waves traveling through the air, essentially capturing the electromagnetic energy.
3. **Conversion:** Inside the radio receiver, the incoming radio waves are transformed into an electrical signal using a process called ""reception"". 
4. **Signal Amplification:** This weak electrical signal is then amplified to a strong level that can be understood by the speaker in your radio.
5. **Sound Production:** The amplified signal gets sent to the speaker, where it vibrates and produces the audible sound waves we hear as music or news.

1. **Signal Reception:** The TV antenna picks up either over-the-air broadcast (analog or digital) or signals transmitted via cables or satellite.  This is the same principle as a radio, but instead of picking up the waves themselves, the TV's antenna captures the information encoded in them.
2. **Decoding and Signal Processing:** The receiver component in the television decodes these signals. This is where the magic happens! It converts raw electrical data into a recognizable format for the screen. 
3. **Image Conversion:**  The decoded signal gets processed by a system of filters and converters that translate the information into a visual image. This involves manipulating the colors and brightness, as well as converting it to specific formats like NTSC or PAL (for analog signals).
4. **Display:** The image is then displayed on a screen which can be an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), LED (Light Emitting Diode) or Plasma panel that are essentially light sources controlled by electrical circuits. 
5. **Sound:** A separate component generates the sound from the encoded audio data transmitted along with the signal, and speakers translate this into audible sounds.

How does a mobile phone work?,"By converting voice into an electric signal, amplifying it, and transmitting it as a radio wave.",Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 10:09,"Here's how a mobile phone works, broken down into key components and processes:

**1. Cellular Network:**

* **Base Stations (Cell Towers):** Mobile phones connect to nearby cell towers that act like relays. These towers are strategically placed to provide coverage across a geographical area. 
* **Cellular Technology:**  The communication is done using cellular technology, which uses radio waves to transmit and receive signals. The specific type of cellular technology used (GSM, CDMA, LTE, etc.) defines the standard for network compatibility.

**2. Phone Hardware:**

* **SIM Card:** A Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card stores your phone number and network credentials for security. 
* **Antenna:** The antenna receives radio waves from the cell tower and transmits them to it. 
* **Microphone:**  The microphone captures sound input from the speaker or the user's voice. 

**3. Operating System:**

* **Software:** Your phone uses an operating system (like Android or iOS) for managing tasks like:
   - Running apps.
   - Managing data storage. 
   - Processing voice calls, text messages, internet browsing, etc.
   

**4. Network Connections & Data Transmission:**

* **Radio Waves & Frequency Bands:** Your phone uses radio waves to communicate with the cell tower.  The signal is transmitted using specific frequency bands (like GSM, UMTS/HSPA+, LTE) allocated by governments and telecommunication companies. 
* **Data Transfer & Calls:** When you make a call, your phone transmits voice data as digital signals (converted into frequencies) and sends it to the intended recipient's phone via radio waves. Your internet connection relies on similar processes.


**Simplified Analogy:**  Imagine your mobile phone is like a relay race. The starting point is you dialing the number. As you speak, your phone uses its internal microphone to convert your voice into electronic signals, and transmits them via radio waves to the nearest cell tower. This tower then relays the signal to the recipient's cell tower, which converts it back into sound to be heard.

 **Additional Notes:**

* **Network Infrastructure:**  The entire process relies on a complex network infrastructure that includes base stations, fiber optic cables, and servers that manage data transmission and communication routing within the mobile network.
* **Evolution of Technology:** Mobile phones are constantly evolving with advancements in cellular technology and hardware design to offer faster speeds, better battery life, larger storage, and new functionalities like cameras, GPS navigation, etc.

Ernest Rutherford's (1871-1937 A.D) nuclear theory regarding atoms and Neill Bohr's (1885-1962 A.D) concept of electron layers in the hydrogen atoms were very important step of atomic physics.</p> <p>The next important discovery was made in 1938. At this time Otto Hann (1879-1968 A.D) and Stresemann (1902-1980 A.D) found out that nucleus was fissionable. Due to fission a nucleus of large mass number splits up into two nuclei of approximately equal mass number and a part of its mass is converted into energy as a result of which atom bomb and nuclear reactor are invented. The amount of energy we are getting at present from the nucleus is huge compared to the energy obtained from all the sources in the past. Day by day nuclear energy is becoming the principal source of energy. In this century quantum theory of the relativity etc. was developed in the field of theoretical physics. Satyendranath Basu (1894-1974 A.D) professor of physics, University of Dhaka made important contribution on theoretical physics. "
What are the three energetic rays emitted by radioactive elements?,"Alpha, beta, and gamma.",Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 10:09,"The three energetic rays emitted by radioactive elements are:

1. **Alpha radiation:** Consists of helium nuclei (two protons and two neutrons). They have a very high ionizing power but can be stopped by a sheet of paper.
2. **Beta radiation:**  This consists of electrons or positrons, which carry a negative or positive charge respectively. Beta particles are less penetrating than alpha rays. 
3. **Gamma radiation:** These are electromagnetic waves with the highest energy. They have no mass and cannot be stopped by most materials.


Let me know if you'd like to learn more about these types of radiation! 😊 
","Page Unknown: Radioactivity</h2> <p>In 1896, French scientist Henry Becquerel observes that a radiation with special penetrating power emits spontaneously from the nucleus of Uranium metal in a continuous manner. He also observes that the element that emits radiation, transforms totally into a new element. This is a nuclear event. This event is a spontaneous and continuous phenomenon and fully controlled by the nature. Any manmade external influences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase or decrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events. They noticed that similar type of radiation also emits from the heavy elements like Polonium, Thorium and Actinium etc. This radiation is now-a-days known as radioactive rays. The phenomenon of emission of radioactive rays or particles from an element is called radioactivity. Radioactive elements emit three energetic rays, namely alpha, beta and gamma. As a result they transform into lighter elements by the process of disintegration. As the Radium metal transforms into Lead step by step through radioactive disintegration. The unit which is used to measure radioactivity is named Becquerel.</p> <h2>13.2. Properties Of Alpha, Beta And Gamma Rays</h2> <p>Alpha particle: Alpha particle is a Helium nucleus. There are two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus. The penetrating power of alpha particle is less; it cannot pass through 6 cm thick air. These particles are influenced by both the magnetic and electric field.
