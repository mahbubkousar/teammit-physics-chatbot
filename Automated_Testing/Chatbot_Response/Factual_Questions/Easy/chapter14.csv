Page Unknown: The growth, development and benefit of science are enjoyed by all people of all nations. From ancient time scientist have been contributing for the development of science. In this lesson we will try to mention the contributions of physicists. Thales (624-569 B.C) is famous for his predictions regarding solar eclipse. He also knew about the magnetic properties of loadstone. Pythagoras (527-497 B.C) is a memorable name in the history of science. Beside the invention of several Geometric theorem, he made longer lasting contribution through his works on vibrating string. He was given several Geometric theorem .Moreover, he made long lasting contributions through his works on vibrating strings. The present scales of musical instruments and music are partially the contributions of his research on the vibration of strings. Greek philosopher Democritus (460-370 B.C) gave the idea that the matter consists of indivisible units. He called it atom. His concept about atom was significant even though it is completely different from the present concept. Greek scientist Archimedes (287-212 B.C) discovered the principles of lever and the law of upward force acting on bodies immersed in liquid and was able to determine the impurity in metals. He also knew the technique of setting fire by concentrating sun rays with the help of spherical mirrors.</p> <p>After Archimedes, scientific discoveries advanced rather slowly for a few centuries. In fact scientific discoveries did not revive in Europe before the thirteenth century. During this time West European civilization particularly adopted the trends of the Byzantine and Muslim civilization in the pursuit of knowledge. The Arabs were also particularly advanced in Science, Mathematics, Astronomy, Chemistry and Medical Science. "

What is the relationship between the human body and a machine?,The human body behaves like a machine in many aspects.,Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 10:12,"The text compares the human body to a complex machine in several ways, highlighting the following analogies:

**Similarities:**

* **Functioning Systems:** Both the human body and machines function with coordinated systems of parts. For example, the heart acts like an automatic pump for blood circulation, while the kidneys filter waste materials. 
* **Energy Conversion:**  Both utilize chemical energy (food intake) to power their functions. Just as machines convert chemical energy into mechanical energy for movement, human bodies do the same, converting it into motion and heat. 
* **Interconnectedness:**  Like a complex machine with interdependent parts, the human body relies on all its components working in harmony.

**Differences:**

* **Complexity and Self-Organization:** The text specifically emphasizes that the human body's self-organization and complexity are far beyond what any machine could achieve. The human body develops from a single cell into a fully functional being through intricate processes, while machines can only be built by humans according to pre-defined plans.
* **Dynamic Adaptation:** The body is highly adaptable, capable of responding to changing environments and internal conditions. Machines lack this flexibility and rely on programmed instructions. 
* **Irreducible Functionality:** The text mentions the human body can continue to function even if one part fails while machines require specific functions for everything to work.

**In essence:**  While we compare the human body to a machine, it's crucial to remember that humans are more than just complex machines. We possess consciousness, emotions, and the ability to adapt and learn beyond any machine's capacity. 
","Page Unknown: 'Response in the Living and Non-Living' is a mentionable book of him.</p> <p>Jagadish Chandra Bose expired dated on 23rd November 1937.</p> <h2>14.3 Human Body And Machine</h2> <p>We use different types of devices to meet our various needs of everyday life such asautomobiles, refrigerator, television, steam engine, internal combustion engine etc. Many people designated human body as a machine. Though human body is not a machine at all, it behaves as a machine in many aspects. As like as a machine, it is also made up of many small parts or organs, absence or infirmity of one organ the activities of the whole body is disturbed. Each part of the body, like each part of a machine, does special jobs. Each organ of human body is interconnected with other organs, each organ runs at its own individual speed, but all function in a specific way and there is a predetermined relationship to each other. In this sense, the human body is analogous to the most complicated man-made machines. Heart, kidneys, lungs, liver etc. are such parts of human body. As for example- heart is actually an automatic pump, which is able to circulate blood throughout the whole body by its own electric signal without any external stimulation. On the contrary, kidney is a special filtration machine which eliminates the nitrogenated waste materials of the body.</p> <p>Due to the coordination of functions of such small machines the whole human body remains active.</p> <p>Human body is like an organic machine.

Page Unknown: Energy is needed in a machine to do work. In different engines using fuels like petrol, diesel, CNG etc. we convert chemical energy into mechanical energy. Similarly, human body also transforms chemical energy into mechanical and heat energy by food ingestion and respiration. Therefore, human body is like an organic machine in fact. But, in many aspects, human body is more amazing than the most complex machine made by humans. Human body can perform such functions which is not possible for any machine. For instance- human body develops from only one cell. With the passage of time, this single cell transforms into a complete human body, which is build with thousand billions of cells. But this doesn't happen in case of any machine. Sometimes functions of the whole body stops due to infirmity of only one part of the body. For example- when function of the heart stops, functions of all other parts of the body stops too, and functions of the brain also stops very quickly.</p> <h2>14.4 Instruments Used For Diagnosis Of Diseases</h2> <p>Once the doctors were used to identifying diseases by observing different external symptoms of the patients and prescribed medicine and diet accordingly. Modern instruments to identify diseases were not invented at that time. As a result, it was not possible to locate the exact positions of different organs. In addition, in which degree a particular organ of the patient is infected was not possible to know. Various types of instruments are invented utilizing different technologies of science to diagnose diseases.</p> <p>With the help of these instruments it became possible to determine diseases properly.

What is the challenge of bio-physics?,To explain the complexities of life using simple laws of physics.,Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 10:12,"The provided text highlights that **bridging the gap between seemingly disparate fields** is a major challenge for Bio-physics.  It seeks to connect the study of life with fundamental laws governing physical systems, which necessitates considering both the complexities of biological processes and the precise principles of physics. 

Here's why this is so challenging:

* **Complexity of Life:** Biological systems are incredibly intricate, involving a vast number of interacting molecules and networks that often defy traditional scientific understanding.
* **Multidisciplinary Approach:** Bio-physics requires integrating concepts from diverse fields like physics, chemistry, biology, and even computer science to decipher the underlying principles governing life's processes. 
* **Lack of ""Closed"" Systems:**  Biology often involves interconnected, dynamic systems that are inherently complex and hard to study in isolation. This makes it challenging to apply traditional physics equations and models to living systems.


It is like trying to understand a multi-dimensional symphony played by an orchestra of diverse instruments. Each instrument represents a different biological system and their combined sounds create the music of life.  Bridging this ""instrument gap"" to decipher their interplay is a key challenge in biophysics.

Page Unknown: It is impossible for a doctor to identify a disease without the right instrument, which is necessary to perform that particular test. The specific cause for a particular disease became known to us due to the invention of different devices. Once people used to believe different superstitions related to disease due to ignorance. In the modern society, the mortality rate is decreased by a large amount. The principal reason behind this is that physical instruments are being used for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment. In this section, some of the instruments which are generally used for diagnosis of diseases are discussed.</p> <h2>X-Ray</h2> <p>X-ray is a kind of electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength of X-ray is much lesser than that of the ordinary light. Its wavelength is about 1010 m. X-ray was invented by Wilhelm Roentgen in 1895. Another name of Roentgen ray is X-ray. When the nature of Roentgen ray was not known, for being an unknown ray it was named X-ray. The power of X-ray to penetrate any material becomes more as its wavelength gets smaller.</p> <p>Ordinary light is visible and divided into different colours, but X-ray is invisible. If an opaque medium is placed in the path of ordinary light, it cannot penetrate the medium.</p> <p>On the other hand X-ray has high penetrating power. X-ray is produced in an X-ray tube.</p> <p>X-ray tube is a vacuum glass tube. There are two electrodes placed at the two ends of the glass tube. "
What is ultra sonography?,A diagnostic procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of internal organs.,Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 10:12,"Ultrasonography (often called ""ultrasound"") is a medical imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of internal organs and tissues within the body. 

Here's how it works:

* **Sound Waves:** A transducer, an instrument that generates sound waves, emits ultrasonic sound waves into the body tissue.
* **Reflection:** These waves bounce off of different parts of the body (like organs or blood vessels) and return to the transducer. 
* **Signal Processing:** The transducer records and processes the reflected sound waves, creating a detailed image on a screen that is used by doctors to diagnose various conditions.

**Uses of Ultrasonography:**

Ultrasound is widely used for various medical purposes, including:

* **Pregnancy Monitoring:**  Monitoring fetal development during pregnancy.
* **Diagnosis of Heart Problems:**  Detecting abnormalities in heart valves and blood flow.
* **Musculoskeletal Evaluation:** Diagnosing injuries and conditions like muscle tears or tendon inflammation.
* **Vascular Imaging:** Examining blood vessels for blockages, aneurysms, and other issues. 

**Advantages:**

* **Non-Invasive:** Unlike some imaging techniques like biopsies, ultrasound doesn't require needles or incisions.
* **Safe:** Ultrasound does not expose patients to ionizing radiation.  
* **Real-Time Imaging:** Allows doctors to observe how organs are functioning during a procedure.

What is CT scan?,A diagnostic procedure that uses X-rays and computer technology to create detailed images of internal organs.,Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 10:12,"CT stands for **Computed Tomography**. It's a sophisticated medical imaging technique that creates detailed cross-sectional images of the body using X-rays.  Here's how it works:

**The Process:**

1. **X-ray Beams:** A CT scanner rotates around the patient, emitting multiple X-ray beams from different angles.
2. **Image Creation:** Each X-ray beam passes through the body, and a detector captures the varying amounts of X-rays absorbed by different tissues (fat, bone, muscles). 
3. **Computer Processing:** A specialized computer then analyzes this information to build detailed images called ""slices"" that show cross-sections of organs, bones, and soft tissue structures.

**Advantages of CT Scan:**

* **Detailed Imaging:** CT scans provide very detailed, high-resolution images of internal structures in multiple planes (horizontally or vertically).
* **Quick and Efficient:** CT scans are relatively quick compared to other imaging techniques like MRI, allowing doctors to diagnose conditions faster. 
* **Versatile Applications:**  CT scans are widely used for a variety of medical applications, including:
    * **Bone Fractures:** Identifying the location and extent of bone breaks.
    * **Tumors:** Detecting and evaluating tumors in various body parts.
    * **Abdominal Problems:** Diagnosing digestive system issues like ulcers or bowel obstruction. 
    * **Lung Diseases:** Visualizing lung abnormalities, including infections or cancers.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Radiation Exposure:** CT scans use ionizing radiation, so there's a potential for some exposure to harmful X-rays. However, modern CT scanners are designed with protocols to minimize radiation dose.

What is endoscopy?,A diagnostic procedure that uses a flexible tube with a camera to visualize internal organs.,Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 10:12,"Endoscopy is a medical procedure that uses a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) with a camera to visualize the inner lining of your body. This allows doctors to examine organs and tissues in detail without surgery. 


Here's how it works:

* **Insertion:** The endoscope is inserted through a small incision or natural opening in the body, typically using a speculum for access.
* **Visualisation:**  A camera on the endoscope transmits real-time images to a monitor, allowing the doctor to clearly see the internal structures.
* **Procedures:** Depending on the purpose of the procedure, the doctor can: 
    * Biopsy: Take small tissue samples for analysis
    * Removal: Remove polyps or other growths
    * Treatment: Inject medication or heat energy directly into the area


**Common Uses of Endoscopy:**

* **Gastrointestinal (GI) tract:** Colonoscopies to screen for colon cancer, gastroscopies to diagnose stomach problems like ulcers and gastritis. 
* **Respiratory system:** Bronchoscopies to examine airways for infections, tumors, or other abnormalities.
* **Other organs:**  Endoscopy can be used to access the urinary tract, liver, gallbladder, etc., depending on the medical need.

**Advantages of Endoscopy:**
* **Minimally Invasive:** The procedure is often less invasive and causes less pain compared to traditional surgery.
* **Faster Recovery:** Patients generally recover faster after an endoscopic procedure than those who undergo surgery. 
* **Reduced Risk of Complications:**  The risk of complications, such as bleeding or infection, is lower compared to surgery for many procedures.

Page Unknown: Half-Life Of A Radioactive Element</h2> <p>We can't say which atom of a radioactive element will decay and when it will take place. But we can calculate how many atoms will decay in a particular time. A cluster of atoms is considered to study the decay of atoms. The time during which just half of the total number of radioactive atoms undergoes disintegration is called the half-life of that element. As for example, let us assume that there are 800000 atoms in a radioactive element. The time required for the decay of its half i.e. 400000 atoms to transform into a new element is known as its half-life. After a next half-life, there remains 200000 numbers of atoms. After another half-life, the number of atoms will be 100000 and thus it will continue. Here a law of possibility works, which atom will disintegrate when, none can say it.</p> <h2>13.4: Uses Of Radioactivity</h2> <p>There are a lot of uses of radioactivity in medical science, agriculture and industries. In medical science especially to treat incurable cancer, the uses of radioactivity are frequent now-a-days. In medical science, the radioactive isotopes are used as radioactive tracers to diagnose different diseases like blockage of kidney, thyroid problems etc. In agriculture, radioactive tracers are being successfully used, especially to develop high yielding variety of seeds and in the research to produce special type of fertilizer necessary for trees.

What is the use of isotopes in medical science?,"To diagnose and treat diseases, such as cancer and thyroid disorders.",Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 10:12,"Isotopes play a crucial role in medical science, particularly in diagnostic imaging and treatment planning. Here's how: 

* **Diagnostic Imaging:** Some isotopes are incorporated into imaging agents like radiotracers that attach to specific tissues or organs.  This allows doctors to see inside the body with greater detail and precision using techniques like PET scans (positron emission tomography) and SPECT scans (single photon emission computed tomography). 
* **Cancer Treatment:** Radioactive isotopes can be used in targeted radiation therapy for cancer treatment. The isotopes are delivered directly to cancerous cells, damaging them and minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue.  This is often a highly targeted form of treatment for specific cancers.
* **Treatment Monitoring:** Isotopes can also be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatments like chemotherapy or radiotherapy. By measuring how quickly an isotope decays in a patient's body, doctors can evaluate whether the treatment is working as intended and adjust their plans accordingly.  

Overall, isotopes are valuable tools in medical science because they provide a unique window into the human body, allowing for more accurate diagnoses, targeted treatments, and efficient monitoring of patients' progress.

What is the principle of ultra sonography?,Reflection of sound waves of high frequency.,Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 10:12,"The principle of ultrasound imaging, also known as ultrasonography, is based on the interaction between sound waves (ultrasound) and biological tissues. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Sound Waves:** Ultrasound utilizes high-frequency sound waves that can penetrate human tissue but are reflected differently depending on their density and structure.
* **Echoes:** When these ultrasound waves encounter different structures within the body, they get reflected back to the transducer (the device emitting the sound). These echoes then return as detected signals. 
* **Signal Processing:** A specialized device receives and analyzes these echoes.  The way the echoes arrive back at the transducer is analyzed by computer software, generating a real-time image of the internal body structures like blood vessels, organs, or fetal development.

Essentially, ultrasound relies on the principle that different tissues have varying densities and acoustic properties, leading to reflected signals that are used to create images of the inner workings of the body.

* **Radiotracers:**  Tc-99m is often incorporated into radiopharmaceuticals called ""radiotracers"". These tracers are designed to bind to specific receptors or tissues within the body. This allows doctors to visualize those areas with high sensitivity and accuracy through various imaging techniques like:
    * **Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT):**  Tc-99m emits gamma rays, creating images that highlight blood flow, metabolic activity, and organ function. 
    * **Positron Emission Tomography (PET):** Tc-99m can be used in combination with other radiotracers for PET scans to identify abnormalities in metabolism and disease processes.

* **Bone Imaging:**  Tc-99m is a great tool for bone imaging, particularly for detecting fractures, tumors, or areas of increased activity. 

* **Cardiac Diagnosis:** Tc-99m is used in heart imaging to diagnose various cardiac conditions like coronary artery disease, valve problems, and heart failure. It helps assess blood flow, perfusion, and muscle damage within the heart. 
    
* **Thyroid Imaging:** Tc-99m radiotracers are often used for thyroid scans to evaluate thyroid function and detect potential abnormalities in this crucial endocrine gland.

* **Gastrointestinal Studies:**  Tc-99m can be used in gastrointestinal imaging to study digestive conditions, such as bowel diseases and ulcers, by focusing on the movement of food through the digestive system. 



Technetium-99m's widespread use stems from its:
* **Short Half-life:** It has a relatively short half-life (6 hours) which means it decays quickly after administration, allowing for timely imaging.

How does the human body behave like a machine?,The human body is made up of many small parts or organs that work together to perform specific functions.,Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 10:12,"The human body, while incredibly complex and intricate, can be likened to a machine in several ways. 

**Here's how:**

* **Systems & Processes:**  The human body operates on a network of interconnected systems that work together – just like the various gears and parts within a machine. Think of your nervous system as the control board, circulatory system as the transportation network, digestive system as a processing unit, etc. Each system has its own specialized function, working in harmony to keep you alive. 
* **Inputs & Outputs:**  Like machines, our bodies take in various inputs – food, air, light, emotions, stimuli. This information is processed and converted into outputs – movement, responses, reactions, creation of bodily fluids, etc. These outputs are crucial for the body's continued functioning and survival. 
* **Energy & Mechanics:** Just like machines rely on energy to operate (think batteries or fuel), we require energy in the form of food. Our bodies utilize this energy through a complex process of breaking down nutrients and converting them into usable energy that powers movement, thoughts, and functions.  
* **Maintenance & Repair:**  Like any machine, our bodies require regular maintenance to ensure smooth functioning. The immune system constantly repairs damage, cells renew themselves, and hormones regulate systems for optimal performance. 

**However, it's important to remember:**

* **Complexity:** Machines are limited by their basic function and rigid design; the human body is infinitely complex with a vast network of cells interacting in ways beyond our current understanding.
* **Consciousness & Emotions:**  Machines lack consciousness or emotions. We possess a unique capacity for awareness, feeling, and self-reflection that machines cannot replicate. 


**In conclusion:** While the analogy of a machine can provide an initial framework for understanding how our body functions, it's vital to remember the inherent complexity, adaptability, and unique nature of human physiology.

Each part of the body, like each part of a machine, does special jobs. Each organ of human body is interconnected with other organs, each organ runs at its own individual speed, but all function in a specific way and there is a predetermined relationship to each other. In this sense, the human body is analogous to the most complicated man-made machines. Heart, kidneys, lungs, liver etc. are such parts of human body. As for example- heart is actually an automatic pump, which is able to circulate blood throughout the whole body by its own electric signal without any external stimulation.

What is the advantage of using ultra sonography in medical science?,"It is a fast, relatively safe, and reliable technique.",Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 10:12,"Ultrasonography, also known as ultrasound, offers several advantages in medical science for a variety of applications. Here's a breakdown:

**Non-Invasive:**  This is arguably its biggest advantage. Ultrasound uses sound waves to visualize internal organs and structures without the need for any injections or incisions. This makes it very safe and painless for patients. 

**Real-Time Imaging:** It provides real-time, dynamic images of the body's tissues as they move. This allows doctors to see how structures are changing, what is happening during a procedure, and monitor conditions over time with accuracy.

**High Resolution:**  Ultrasonography can be used at high resolutions to clearly visualize fine details like blood vessels, small organs (such as the pancreas), or fetal development. 

**Cost-Effective:** Compared to other diagnostic methods like MRI or CT scans, ultrasound is often more affordable, especially for routine screening purposes. 


**Other Advantages:**
* **Painless and Safe:**  The procedure itself is very safe for patients with no or minimal discomfort associated with it.  
* **Versatile:** Ultrasound can be used in various medical fields, including obstetrics (pregnancy monitoring), cardiology (heart function assessment), gynecology (pelvic exams), and urology (kidney and bladder issues).
