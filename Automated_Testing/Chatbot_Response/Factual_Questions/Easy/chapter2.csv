What is the term used to describe the state of an object that is not changing its position with time?,Rest,Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 8:56,"##  State of an Object in Rest

**Given Information:**
- The question asks about the state of an object that does not change its position with time. 
- A reference point or origin, a fixed object to which we compare the position and motion of another object.


*Ani's text mentions objects like houses, plants, trees, electric poles are said to be at rest.*

**Answer:** The term used to describe the state of an object that is not changing its position with time is **static or at rest**.

What is the dimension of displacement?,[L],Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 8:56,"The dimension of displacement is **L** (length). This means it's measured in meters. 

Here's why:

Page Unknown: As for example, the dimensional equation of force is [ F ] = [ MLT2 ] Except these above mentioned three physical quantities of length, mass and time others dimension of physical quantities are : The dimension of temperature as 0 (Capital alphabet of Greek letter 0), the dimension of electric current as I, the dimension of luminous intensity as J and the dimension of amount of substance as N.</p> <p>We can verify the validity of any equation or formula by analyzing dimension. For example, the following equation may be considered: S = ut + at2 We know that addition, subtraction or equivalence are possible for any same kind of quantities. Hence every term of an equation must indicate the same kind of quantity, that is, the dimension of every term must be the same. Now there are three terms in the above equation, one to the left and two to the right.</p> <p>In this equation, s is displacement : its dimension is L, u is initial velocity; its dimension is '/r = LT-1 a is acceleration ; its dimension is '/T2 = LT-2 t is time ; its dimension is T.</p> <p>∴The dimension is ut = LT¹ x T = L The dimension of at2 = LT-2 x T2 = L Thus it is seen that the dimension of each of the term on both sides of the above equation is the same L.

If Mitu covers the same distance in 40 seconds, who goes faster ? Ovi or Mitu, definitely Mitu goes faster because she takes less time. Suppose, Ovi travels 100m in 50 seconds, Mitu travels 75m in 30 seconds can we say Ovi goes slower than Mitu ? Does not Ovi travel more distance than Mitu ? The distance of a particular time Ovi and Mitu travels has to be compared to know who goes faster.

Since the unit of distance is meter (m) and unit of time is second (s), unit of speed is meter/second (ms-1). The speed of a body is 4ms1 means that the body moves a distance of 4m in 1second. Though the unit of speed is meter/second, for our convenience sometimes we consider the unit of speed is kilometer/hour where the unit of distance is kilometer and of time is hour. "

What is the term used to describe the rate of change of velocity with time?,Acceleration,Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 8:56,"The term used to describe the rate of change of velocity with time is **acceleration**. 
","Page Unknown: In the next 8 seconds the velocity of the car increases by 4ms . In the way the velocity of the car increases by 4ms-1 in every 8 seconds. In other words the change of velocity of the car is 0.5ms-1. So, the rate of change of velocity of the car with time is 0.5ms-1.</p> <p>The rate of change of velocity with time that is the change of velocity in unit time is known as acceleration. The rate of increase of velocity with time of a body moving in a straight line is called positive acceleration and the rate of decrease of velocity of a body with time is called negative acceleration.

It has direction. Its direction is along the change of velocity. Since we are considering the motion along a straight line, change of direction of velocity will be either along the direction of velocity or opposite to the velocity. If the velocity increases than the change of velocity takes place along the velocity. In this case acceleration will be positive.

What is the standard value of g on the surface of the Earth?,9.8ms-2,Factual,Easy,10/23/2024 8:56,"The standard value of *g* (the acceleration due to gravity) on the surface of the Earth is approximately **9.81 m/s²**.

","Page Unknown: Hence the values of</code>g' is not the same at all places on earth. The polar radius <code>R' is the shortest and so the value of</code>g' at the pole is the maximum. And the value of R is the longest at the equator. So the value of <code>g' at the equation is the minimum. Since the value of 'g' is different at different places on the surface of the earth, its value at sea level altitude 45° is accepted as the standard value. This standard value of</code>g' is 9.80665ms2. For convenience the standard value of `g' is taken to be 9.8ms2 or 9.81ms2.</p> <p>Falling Bodies : If a body is dropped from a certain height, it falls on earth due to the influence of gravity. If a heavy and a light object are dropped from the same height simultaneously, will they reach the ground at the same time ?</p> <p>In fact, if a piece of stone and a piece of paper are dropped from the same height, it is seen that the stone reaches the ground first. Since the acceleration due to gravity does not dropped on the mass of the body, the acceleration of the stone and that of the paper would be the same. So they should reach at the same time on the earth, but due to the resistance of air two bodies reach at different time on the earth.
