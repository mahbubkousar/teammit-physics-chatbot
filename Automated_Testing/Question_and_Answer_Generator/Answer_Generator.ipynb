The main objectives of physics are to establish the relation between matter and energy and to express it quantitatively on the basis of observation, experimentation and analysis.</p> <h2>Scope Of Physics :</h2> <p>Physics is the key of all science. It is the fundamental branch of science because the foundation of other subjects is based on the principles of physics. For example, the principle of conservation of energy is a basic principle of physics used to explain the wide range of science starting from the structure of atom to weather forecasting. Starting from Engineering to Medical Science, Astronomy to Oceanology, Biology to Psychology the instruments of Physics are used. For the systematic study of physics, we can divide it into the following branches : (1) Mechanics (2) Heat and thermodynamics (3) Sound (4) Optics (5) Electricity and Magnetism (6) Solid State Physics (7) Atomic Physics (8) Nuclear Physics (9) Quantum Physics and (10) Electronics</p> <h2>Development Of Physics:</h2> <p>Modern civilization is the product of science.

            " The growth, development and benefit of science are enjoyed by all people of all nations. From ancient time scientist have been contributing for the development of science. In this lesson we will try to mention the contributions of physicists. Thales (624-569 B.C) is famous for his predictions regarding solar eclipse. He also knew about the magnetic properties of loadstone. Pythagoras (527-497 B.C) is a memorable name in the history of science. Beside the invention of several Geometric theorem, he made longer lasting contribution through his works on vibrating string. He was given several Geometric theorem .Moreover, he made long lasting contributions through his works on vibrating strings. The present scales of musical instruments and music are partially the contributions of his research on the vibration of strings. Greek philosopher Democritus (460-370 B.C) gave the idea that the matter consists of indivisible units. He called it atom. His concept about atom was significant even though it is completely different from the present concept. Greek scientist Archimedes (287-212 B.C) discovered the principles of lever and the law of upward force acting on bodies immersed in liquid and was able to determine the impurity in metals. He also knew the technique of setting fire by concentrating sun rays with the help of spherical mirrors.</p> <p>After Archimedes, scientific discoveries advanced rather slowly for a few centuries. In fact scientific discoveries did not revive in Europe before the thirteenth century. During this time West European civilization particularly adopted the trends of the Byzantine and Muslim civilization in the pursuit of knowledge. The Arabs were also particularly advanced in Science, Mathematics, Astronomy, Chemistry and Medical Science. \n",
            "Chunk 9:\n",
            " During this time the contribution of Ibne-Al-Haithan (965-1039 A.D) and Al-Hazen (965-1038 A.D) may be particularly mentioned for their theories of light, a branch of physics. Ptolemy (127-151 A.D) and other earlier scientists believed that the eyes itself sends light rays to see an object. Al-Hazen contradicted this view and asserted that we see an object because light rays from the object fall on our eyes. Experiments with magnifying glass brought him near to the modern theory of convex lens. Al-Masudi (896-956 A.D) wrote an encyclopedia on the History of Nature in which the name of Windmill was first mentioned. At present many countries of the world produce electricity by using this windmill. Roger Bacon (1214-1294 A.D) was the pioneer of the experimental scientific methods. According to him all scientific truths should be verified through observations and experiments. At the end of the fifteenth century, Leonardo de Vinci (1452-1519 A.D) made a model of aero plane by observing the act of flying of birds. Although he was a painter, he had considerable knowledge about mechanics. As a result, he was able to invent efficiently some common instruments. During the Galileo-Newtonian age and even before that time a few of very important scientists, although small in number were born. They contributed a lot to the advancement of science too. Dr. Gilbert (1540-1603 A.D) is unforgettable for his extensive research and theory on magnetism. \n",
            "Chunk 10:\n",
            " Snell (15911626 A.D) of Germany discovered the laws of refraction of light. Huygen (1626-1695 A.D) reviewed the motion of pendulum, developed the mechanical device of clocks and invented the wave theory of light. Robert Hook (1635-1703 A.D) strove to find out the elastic properties of bodies. Robert Boyle (1627-1691 A.D) conducted experiments to find out the properties of gases at different pressures. Von Guerick (1602-1686 A.D) invented air pump. Romer (1644-1710 A.D) measured the velocity of light by studying the eclipse of a satellite of Jupiter, but none of his contemporary scientist believed that velocity of light could be so high. Kepler (1571-1630 A.D) presented three laws for a general mathematical explanation of concept of solar-centered theory of Copernicus. Kepler's success was based on his assumption of an elliptical orbit opposed to the conventional circular orbit. He verified the validity of his mathematical laws about the orbits of the planets with the data collected through observation by his teacher Tychobrahe (1546-1601 A.D). The inception of modern scientific method was made by a famous Italian scientist Galileo (1564-1642 A.D). He showed for the first time that the observations, experimentations and definitions of physical quantities systematically and the determination of relations among them are the basic foundation of scientific works.</p> <p>Galileo introduced the scientific trends of developing mathematical theory and verifying its authenticity through experiment. Later, Newton (1642-1727 A.D) gave it a complete shape. \n",
            "Chunk 11:\n",
            " Galileo defined displacement, motion, acceleration, time etc. and determined relations among them. Consequently he discovered the laws of falling bodies and established the foundation of statics. Newton by his versatile genius discovered mechanics and the three famous laws of mechanics and law of universal gravitation. He also made contribution for optics, heat and sound. He invented calculus, a new branch of mathematics. The discovery and inventions of the eighteenth and nineteenth century paved the way for Europe to industrial revolution. The steam engine of James Watt (1736-1819 A.D) played a vital role for industrial revolution. Hans Christian Oersted (1777-1851 A.D) demonstrated the magnetic effect of current. This discovery led Michael Faraday (17911867 A.D), Henry (1797-1879 A.D) and Lenz (1804-1865 A.D) towards discovering the fact that magnetic effect produces electric current. In fact, this was a discovery of the process of converting mechanical energy into electrical energy.</p> <p>In 1864 James Clark Maxwell (1831-1879 A.D) demonstrated that light is one kind of electromagnetic wave. He established the electromagnetic theory by combining electric and magnetic field. Similar kind of radiation was also discovered and produced in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894 A.D). Using the same kind of waves in 1896, Marconi (1874-1937 A.D) discovered the method of sending signal through \"Morse code\" to far off distance. Before him Sir Jagadish Chandra Basu (1858-1937 A.D) was able to send energy from one place to another through electromagnetic wave. In this way radio communication was developed. \n",

            " By the end of nineteenth century Roentgen (1845-1923 A.D) discovered x-rays and Becquerel (1852-1908 A.D) discovered the radio activity of uranium.</p> <p>In the twentieth century surprising advancement took place in the field of physics. Max Planck (1858-1947 A.D) discovered quantum theory of radiation. Albert Einstein (18791955 A.D) invented theory of relativity. These two theories not only explained the previous experimental result but also made some predictions which were experimentally verified. Ernest Rutherford's (1871-1937 A.D) nuclear theory regarding atoms and Neill Bohr's (1885-1962 A.D) concept of electron layers in the hydrogen atoms were very important step of atomic physics.</p> <p>The next important discovery was made in 1938. At this time Otto Hann (1879-1968 A.D) and Stresemann (1902-1980 A.D) found out that nucleus was fissionable. Due to fission a nucleus of large mass number splits up into two nuclei of approximately equal mass number and a part of its mass is converted into energy as a result of which atom bomb and nuclear reactor are invented. The amount of energy we are getting at present from the nucleus is huge compared to the energy obtained from all the sources in the past. Day by day nuclear energy is becoming the principal source of energy. In this century quantum theory of the relativity etc. was developed in the field of theoretical physics. Satyendranath Basu (1894-1974 A.D) professor of physics, University of Dhaka made important contribution on theoretical physics. \n",
            "Chunk 13:\n",
            " He demonstrated a comparatively correct form of Planck's quantum theory. His theory is known as Bose-Einstein's statistics. As recognition of his contribution one kind of elementary particle is named after him and is called Boson. Three nobel laureate physicist Prof. Abdus Salam (19261996 A.D) of Pakistan, Sheldon Glasso (1932-) and Stevan Wienberg (1933-) of United States made outstanding contribution by discovering weak electric force in unifying the elementary particles in unified field theory. Prior to that nobel laureate physicist Chandra Shekhar Ramon (1888-1970 A.D) discovered Ramon effect. Physics has made significant contribution in the progress of medical science in twentieth century. By using radio isotopes along with the discovery of numerous equipments physics has contributed to medical science. Another advancement of physics in twentieth century is exploration in the space. The contribution of physics lies in landing human footprint on the moon along with the staying of months after months in space station and exploration on the Mars. Artificial satellite has contributed to forecast weather and made communication easy. Moreover electronics has already brought about revolution in our daily life and changed our life style. Now a days radio, television, digital camera, mobile phone, i-pad and computer are used almost in every house. Various electronics instruments have developed human's work ability to a great extent. In nineteenth century physics played a vital role for the advancement of medical science.</p> <p>Outstanding contribution of physics in the field of medical science lies in inventing different instrument along with radio isotope for the prevention of diseases. \n",

            " Another advancement of physics in the twentieth century is the exploration in the space.</p> <h2>1.2 Objectives Of Physics :</h2> <p>Physics unearths the mystery of nature: Physics is the fundamental branch of science because its principles are the basis of other branches of science. For example, the principle of conservation of energy is a principle of physics used to explain the wide range of science starting from the structure of atom to weather forecasting. Although the main function of physics is to study matter and energy, the main objective of physics is to realize the rules of nature as well as unearthing the mystery of nature. In the beginning of twentieth century physicist discovered that electrons revolves around the positively charged nucleus of atom. Subsequent experiments proved that nucleus consists of protons and neutrons. Now the physicists have discovered that proton and neutron are formed of more smaller particles. The study of physics helps not only to understand and explain the natural events but also its application plays a vital role in other branches of science. At present physics is at the centre probably because of its application in other branches of science. The discovery of electron at the end of ninetieth century made possible to invent electron microscope which has brought about a revolution in material science and Cytology.</p> <p>In physics there is development of theories and application mathematics at the same time it has practical application and engineering application too. Physics is very essential to give fundamental explanation and form idea about Chemistry, Geology, Astronomy, Meteorology etc. \n",
            "Chunk 15:\n",
            " In addition, there is wide application of methodology and instruments of physics in Biology, Oceanology, Psychology and Medical Science.</p> <p>Physics describes the laws of nature: The natural world that we live in follows some certain laws e.g. Newton's law of gravitation, law of conservation of energy etc. Since our childhood we have been acquiring these laws through our personal experiences which are very essential for our life. We cannot change the function and laws of nature but can utilize them. For their proper utilization we need sufficient knowledge about them. Moreover physics is the science that studies on this earth for innovation. Development of technology results from the proper application of fundamental laws of physics : We have to have knowledge about the fundamental laws of physics if want to know how television works, rocket flies in the space, artificial satellite revolves around the earth, , mobile phone functions, submarine remain submerged into water and how by using internet the whole world can be explored in a moment . The discovered laws of physics pave the way to invent these technologies.</p> <h2>Study Of Physics Is A Perfect Human Training     :</h2> <p>We can achieve new idea by the study of physics. Physics instructs on how to think, show cause, how to put argument, how to utilize logic and mathematics. It stimulates our imagination and develops the power of thinking.</p> <h2>Physics Teaches How To Carry Out Observation:</h2> <p>We can develop our capability of observation. \n",
            "Chunk 16:\n",
            " We can also learn how to carry out systematic observations by studying physics properly</p> <h2>1.3 Space And Time</h2> <p>In science particularly in physics the concept of space and time is very important. We need the concept of space and time to describe any event, because without it we cannot get clear idea about space and time of the event. The concept of space is in vogue from ancient time to locate the position of an object and space occupied by it. Similarly the concept of time is necessary to understand sequence and duration of the event.</p> <p>Euclid's concept: Euclid was fast to present the geometric concept of space.</p> <p>Galileo's concept: Galileo in his book, Statics used space and time in the law of motion and acceleration. Thus space and time have become very important quantities in mathematical equations. Newton's concept: The concept of space and time has become more clear and taken quantitative form through Newtonian mechanics. Space is a three dimensional extension in Newtonian or classical physics. Space has no beginning or end. It has limitless extension. Space can be divided into infinite small parts i.e. space is continuous. Space is homogenous as regions of any space are identical. Space is independent. Though all the events take place and spread within the space; space is never influenced by any object or event. Like space, time is also independent. So, passage of time cannot change space.</p> <h2>1.4 Physical Quantities</h2> <p>Any thing that is measurable in this physical world is called a physical quantity. \n",
            "Chunk 17:\n",
            " For example, the length of a table can be measured. Here, length is a physical quantity. The mass of your body can be measured, mass is a physical quantity. The time during which you are reading this book can be measured, time is a physical quantity. If you apply force to lift some thing, that force can be measured. So force is a physical quantity. There are many such quantities in this physical world. Among these, it is seen that there are a few quantities which can be measured without any help from any other quantities. These quantities are `fundamental quantities'. For instance, to measure the length of a table, you need to measure only the length. To measure this length, there is no need of measuring any other quantity. So, length is a fundamental quantity. On the other hand, measurement of some quantities need the help of other quantities. For example, to measure the density of copper bar it is necessary to measure the mass and volume of a piece of copper bar and then mass is to be divided by the volume. Again, to measure the volume, the length, the breadth and the height are to be measured, that is, lengths are to be measured three times in three directions. So, it is seen that, there are certain quantities which are fundamental. They do not depend on other quantities. These are called fundamental quantities. So, the physical quantities which are independent or neutral that is, they do not depend on other quantity, rather other quantities depend on them, are called fundamental quantities. Scientists have identified seven such quantities as fundamental quantities which are used in all branches of science for measurement. \n",
            "Chunk 18:\n",
            " These are (1) length (2) mass (3) time (4) temperature (5) electric current (6) luminous intensity and (7) amount of substance.</p> <p>All other quantities may be derived from fundamental quantities that means, these are obtained from the product or quotient of one or more fundamental quantities. These are called derived quantities or compound quantities.</p> <p>So, the quantities depend on fundamental quantities or obtain from fundamental quantities are called derived quantities. Velocity, acceleration, force, work, heat, electric current etc. are derived quantities since these are obtain from fundamental quantities.</p> <p>| velocity   |       | velocity               |          | |------------|-------|------------------------|----------| | = mass × - |       | [ · · acceleration = = |          | |            | time  | time                   | ]        | | distance   |       | l                      | distance | | = mass ×   |       | [ *.

Moreover, we need accurate measurement for various research works. \n",
            "Chunk 19:\n",
            " The act of measuring something in our daily life is called measurement. In general, measurement means the act of determining the quantity of something. For example, the distance of the school from Rizu's home is 700 meters. Sohel has bought 5 Kilograms of rice from the shop. Rina takes 50 seconds to go to the school's office room. Here, 700 meters is the distance, 5 kilograms is the mass of rice and 50 seconds is the amount of time spent. We need two things to measure anything. One is number and another is unit. A standard is essential, comparing with which any measurement is done. These standard quantities are called the unit of measurement. Say, the length of a rod is 4 meters. Here, meter is a unit of length and 1 meter is a specific measurement. Therefore, length of the rod 4 meters means length of the rod is 4 times of this 1 meter's unit. There are different units for measurement of time, volume, velocity, mass, force, energy, temperature, electric current etc. These units have been designed in such way that they can be convenient and can be easily and accurately reproduced. Except some units all these units are interrelated with one another.</p> <h2>Fundamental Unit In Si</h2> <p>We can select fundamental units according to your liking, since the units of fundamental quantities do not depend on other units. But our selection must have international recognition. It should have some characteristics as well. For example, it should be unchangeable, that is, independent of place, time and person. It will not change due to passage of time or any other natural change. It could be reproduced easily. \n",

But no change was brought in values of the units. For example, at present, meter is defined in terms of distance traveled by light. Earlier, meter was defined using wavelength of a kind of light. Prior to it, the length of a rod kept at Sevres near Paris in France was taken as the standard of meter.

It's length is 1 meter or 100 centimeters. This is why, it is called a meter scale. One side of this scale is graduated in centimeter and the other side in inches. Each centimeter is divided into ten equal parts. Each of this parts is called 1 millimeter or 0.1 centimeter. Each inch is divided into eight, ten or sixteen equal parts.</p> <p>Measure with a meter scale : To measure the length of a rod or a stick by the meter scale, it's one end is so placed that is coincides with the 0 mark or some other convenient mark of the scale. The reading of the mark that coincides with the other end of the rod is taken. The difference between the readings at the two ends of the rod gives the length of the rod. In general if the reading of the mark that coincides with the left end of the rod is x and that of the mark coinciding with the right end is y. Then the length of the rod is L = y - x. With this scale length may be measured to an accuracy of 1 millimeter. For more accurate measurement vernier scales are used.</p> <h2>Vernier Scale :</h2> <p>In the ordinary meter scale we can measured length up to 1 millimeter. \n",

By using vernier scale along with meter scale fractions of millimeter may be measured accurately. Vernier scale can be moved forward or backward along the side of the main scale. Say, a vernier scale has ten divisions, this ten division is equal to nine smallest divisions of the main scale (fig 1.1). Nine smallest divisions of main scale is 9 millimeter or 0.9 centimeter. As 10 vernier scale divisions is equal to nine smallest divisions of the main scale. So, a vernier scale division is slightly smaller than the smallest division of the main scale. The difference between the smallest main scale division and the vernier scale division is called vernier constant. It is generally written by VC. \n",

Measurement of slide calipers : Suppose, the length of rod is to be measured. The rod is to be placed between the two jaws of the slide calipers. The jaw connected with the vernier scale is to be pushed forward so that the jaws of the main scale and the vernier scale touch the opposite ends of the object. The rod is placed such that it's left end coincides with zero (0) mark of the main scale. The vernier scale is moved forward and backward to make it coincide with the right side of the rod.

            " A solid metal rod inside the hollow pillar can be raised or lowered with the help of a level H connected with the floor. The base of triangular shaped agate is fixed exactly in the middle of the beam AB. The sharp age is kept on an agate plate placed on the solid rod of the beam. When the solid rod is lifted, the beam AB swings about the narrow edge of the agate as the fulcrum. The broad side of a long pointer (PO) is fixed at the middle of the balance. It's lower narrow end is free to move over a scale. When the beam is horizontal, the pointed end of the pointer rests on the zero of the scale. The beam is made horizontal with the help of a plumb-line (PL) and the leveling screws. The entire instrument is kept in a glass box.</p> <p>Measurement by Balance . To use the balance, the handle H is rotated to left the pillar and hence the beam AB . The beam will then start swing freely about the knife edge.</p> <p>Along with the beam the scale pans will also keep in swinging up and down, with the backward rotation of the handle H. The pillar will be lowered and the swinging of the beam and scale pans will stop.</p> <p>When the beam AB swings, the lower end of the pointer keeps oscillating right and left over the scale. If there is nothing on the scale pan, the oscillation of the pointer should be equal on the two sides of the zero of the scale. \n",

Whether the pillar P is vertical or not is seen with the plumb-line PL. To measure the mass of an object it is placed on the left-hand pan. Known weights are placed slowly on the right-hand pan one by one, till the pointer oscillates equally to the two sides of the zero of the scale. Thus the mass of an object is determined with the help of known weights.</p> <h2>Stopwatch</h2> <p>Stopwatch is used to measure small time interval. Stopwatches are of two kinds digital stopwatch and analog stopwatch. Digital stopwatch can give more accurate reading than that of analog stopwatch. A analog stopwatch can give an accurate reading up to ± 0.15 while a digital stopwatch can read accurately up to ±0.015. Now a days digital stopwatch is found in mobile phone also.</p> <p>A stopwatch has to start and stop by the hands to measure a time. An error of about a large fraction of a second takes place in the reading of time interval though it may vary from person to person. The degree of error is more to the old than the young. For most of the people the error is about 0.3seconds.</p> <h2>1.9 Error And Accuracy In Measurement</h2> <p>All measurements have some limitations of accuracy. \n",
            "Chunk 40:\n",
            " Accuracy of measurement depend on the skill of observer and the instruments used. Suppose a meter scale is graduated in centimeter and millimeter. If we want to measure the length of this book we will get the result probably up to 0.1cm accurately. In Accuracy may be reduced in case of measuring the length of a house because the scale is to be used several time for measuring the full length. Every time the position of the front edge of the scale has to be marker on the floor. This increases the source of error thus increasing the probability of errors.</p> <p>The accuracy of measurement is as important as measurement itself. So, the observer should mention the degree of accuracy of result with the result of the experiment. Let the length of this book be 26.0cm ± 0.1cm. Here the symbol ± means that the real length of the book is between 25.9cm and 26.1cm. Here 0.1cm is the uncertainty or error of measurement. Generally there are three types of error in measurement. There are : a) Random error b) Instrumental error c) Personal error a) Random error : The error for which irrelevant occur in measured results by measuring a constant quantities. Several times is random error. The word random itself implies that the error cannot be guessed earlier and expected value will be zero. This is because measured values moves around the accurate value and average value of the errors should be zero if the value of the quantity is measured by the same instrument. The random error will be included as much as many time the scale is used to measure the floor. Each time the front edge marking on the floor falls a little back and forth of the accurate mark. \n",
            "Chunk 41:\n",
            " Another random error takes place with the measurement when the meter scale is placed at the previous marking (slightly error position) as back edge starts from back and forth position. The final result may be very much high or low due to random error. It is impossible to avoid random error but this error can be reduced by precautionary measurement. In order to minimize the random error average of the frequent measurement is to be taken.</p> <p>b) Instrumental error : We need instruments for experimental measurement in physics.</p> <p>The error with the instrument is called instrumental error. For example, if the zero marking of main scale is not super-imposition with the zero marking vernier then the result of measurement will not be accurate. This kind of error is known as instrumental error . Similarly if the indicator needle of ammeter or voltmeter is not super-imposition with the zero marking then there remains error with the instrument. The instrumental error has to be determined before starting the experiment. Finally the actual reading has to be obtained by subtracting this error from the reading.</p> <p>c) Personal error : We have to take various readings during experiment. The error that an experimenter makes during experiment is called personal error. The error with the position of the observer, observing any mark or any calculation is also said to be personal error. For example there will be an error while measuring the length of a rod if the super-imposition of the edge of a rod with a definite mark of the scale is observed obliquely instead of perpendicular position. \n",
            "Chunk 42:\n",
            " There will be error in reading when we cannot observe which division of circular scale is in super-imposition with the linear scale of a time per screw gauge. Similarly we cannot find accurate if there is mistake in counting oscillation number while determining time period of a pendulum. All these are known as personal errors. We have to take the reading properly and carefully with a view to avoiding these errors.</p> <h2>Investigation:1.1</h2> <p>Determination of area and volume of a rectangular substance.</p> <p>Objective : By using slide calipers determining the length of a substance.

If you say your school is in Jheeltuli it is absolutely true but we cannot know the exact position of your school from this information. We can know the exact position only when you mention the position, direction and distance of your school with respect to a particulars place. At first we have to consider a known point or an object with respect to that the position of another point or object is to be determined.

In the above example we could consider any other point as reference point. Rest and motion : We see many object around us of them some are rest and some are in motion.

Does the position of the pen get changed with respect to other objects around ? It does not. The pen in your has a particulars distance and direction with respect to the objects around you such as your chair, table, book, copy, house, door, window and to all other things. So the position of your pen is fixed with respect to other objects around you. The position of the pen is not changing with the change of time. We can say the pen is in rest to the surroundings. The act of remain rest of the pen is called rest. Therefore, a body is said to be static or at rest with respect to its surroundings when it does not change its position with time.

We say the pen is in motion with respect to the surroundings. A body is said to be in motion with respect to its surroundings when it changes its position with time. And this change of position with time is called motion. We discussed earlier that to understand whether an object is in rest or in motion it is necessary to chose a reference object or reference frame. If the relative positions of this considered object and the reference object remain unchanged with time, the considered object is said to be in rest with respect to reference object. If the considered object and the reference object move along the same direction with same velocity even though the distance between the objects, remain unchanged despite the object, being in motion. If two friends remain seated face to face in a running train, then the relative position of one with respect to other does not change.

If the reference frame is actually in rest, object in rest will be : actually in rest with respect to that frame. This type of rest is called absolute rest. A body is said to be in absolutely rest when it is in rest with respect to an absolutely rest object. Similarly absolute motion of a body is its motion with respect to a reference object absolutely at rest. But in this universe it is not possible to get a reference object which is at absolute rest. Since the earth is continuously moving round the sun, while the sun itself is moving along the galaxy with its planets and satellites. Thus when we say that a body is at rest or in motion, we mean it is to be so with respect to a body apparently at rest. So we can say that in this universe all rest and all motion are relative.

When a physical quantity is measured, it has got a magnitude. We express this magnitude in terms of a number and a unit. For example, if we say that the height of the bench is 1.5 meter, we mean that the unit of length is meter and height of the bench is 1.5 times this unit. But all physical quantities cannot be completely expressed by its magnitude only.</p> <p>To express not only magnitude of some quantities is needed but also the direction. For example, if we say that a car is running at the speed of 40 km per hour, it is understood that the car moves a distance 40 km in one hour, but the direction of motion of the car cannot be known from this statement.

The length of the straight line represents the magnitude and the arrow head indicates the direction of the vector. For example, in figure 2.2 displacement of 50km has been represented by 1cm.

It is true that Ovi is 100m away from the gate, but it does not tell the exact position of Ovi. Because Ovi can be 100m away to the east, to the west, to the north, to the south or any other directions. To know exactly the change of position of Ovi, the direction towards which he moved 100m should also be known. If it is stated that Ovi ran 100m from the gate to the east then his exact position will be known definitely. \n",

This is a scalar quantity. In the second case, direction has also been mentioned along with distance, this is called displacement. This is a vector quantity. Change of position or distance in a definite direction is displacement. So, the change of position of an object with respect to its surrounding in a definite direction is called displacement.</p> <p><img alt=\"35_image_1.png\" src=\"35_image_1.png\" /></p> <p><img alt=\"35_image_2.png\" src=\"35_image_2.png\" /></p> <p>The minimum distance, that is, the linear distance between the initial and final position of a body is the magnitude of its displacement at its direction is towards final position from the initial position.</p> <p>The displacement does not depend on the path of the object. An object can move from position A to position B following different paths. But its displacement will be from A towards B. The minimum distance between A and B, that is, in this case the linear distance AB is the magnitude of displacements. AB and its direction is towards B from A.

If Mitu covers the same distance in 40 seconds, who goes faster ? Ovi or Mitu, definitely Mitu goes faster because she takes less time. Suppose, Ovi travels 100m in 50 seconds, Mitu travels 75m in 30 seconds can we say Ovi goes slower than Mitu ? Does not Ovi travel more distance than Mitu ? The distance of a particular time Ovi and Mitu travels has to be compared to know who goes faster.

From the above discussion we can understand time and distance determines who goes faster.</p> <p>The quantity by which we can measure how fast a body moves or distance traveled, is called speed.

Since the unit of distance is meter (m) and unit of time is second (s), unit of speed is meter/second (ms-1). The speed of a body is 4ms1 means that the body moves a distance of 4m in 1second.

Here, average speed 50kmh-1 does not mean the car travels 50km in every hour rather it might travel sometimes faster or sometimes slower than the average speed. Instantaneous speed : If we want to know the instantaneous speed of any body at any instant, for example what was the speed of the car just the moment its 33miniutes travel is over, the speed of that moment will be the instantaneous speed. \n",

On this road, if a car moves with a uniform speed of 20kmh- then we will be able to state correctly that the velocity of the car is 20 kmh-1 towards north at an angle 300 with east. But if the same car moves in a circular road with uniform speed of 20kmh-1 than the direction of its motion will be continuously Fig-2.4 changed.

The body will fall freely without any resistance, that is, no force other than the gravitational force will act on the body. For example, the resistance due to air will not act on it.</p> <h2>Laws Of Falling Bodies Are :</h2> <p>First Law : All bodies falling from rest and from the same height without any resistance traverse equal distance in equal time.</p> <p>Second Law : The velocity (v), acquired by a freely falling body from rest in a given time (t) is directly proportional to time that is, v &amp; t Third Law : The distance (h) traversed by a freely falling body from rest in a given time (t) is directly proportional to the square of the time, that is, h &amp; t2.</p> <p>Equation of falling Body : Let a body be falling freely due to gravity with initial velocity u.

Suppose that one of your friends is riding a bi-cycle on a plane road. At any moment he stopped paddling the cycle. Will the cycle stop at once? We find that the cycle will stop slowly after crossing a small distance. Would the cycle move continuously if there is no air resistance and friction? From this evidence we can understand that everybody has the tendency to remain in the same state as it is. If the body is at rest it continues to be at rest. On the other hand if the body is in motion it continues to be in motion. This tendency or property of a body to maintain its own state is called inertia. Thus the tendency of a body to maintain its own state for ever in which the body is at present or the property of a body to preserve that state is defined as inertia.

For this reason he would hit the steering and other bodies in front of him, for this a serious accident may happen. Not only have the drivers, the passengers also had to wear the seat belt if there is an arrangement of seat belt in the car. We have a general concept about force from our daily life experiences. When we pull or push a body, then we say a force is applied upon the body. This applied force can create or tends to create motion in a stationary body. If the body is in motion, then the applied force can cease the motion of the body or tries to increase its velocity. In both cases to apply force, it needs direct contact between the force applier and the body. These types of force are known as contact force. If the two bodies are not in direct contact, still they can apply force on each other. Such a well-known force is the force of gravitation, whose practical example is the weight of a body. When a body falls from your hand, then it quickly touches the ground. What is the reason? It happens due to the weight or attraction of the earth on the body. We define this force as the force of gravitation. In this way we feel the existence of different type of forces in different events of nature. For example- the magnetic force between two poles of a magnet, the electrical force between two charged bodies, nuclear force within the nucleus. Now we will see how we can get concept about inertia and force from Newton's first law of motion. \n",

            " Newton's first law of motion is- 'Every object will continue in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless an external force is applied to it.' Newton's first law expresses the property of inertia of matter. From Newton's first law of motion we observe that a body cannot change its state on its own. If the body is at rest, it tends to remain at rest forever and if it is in motion it tends to keep on motion with uniform speed for all time. This property of a body is termed as inertia. Thus from the Newton's first law of motion we get the concept of inertia.</p> <p>Again from Newton's first law we see that to change the state of a body something external must be applied. That is, the external cause which changes or tends to change the state of an object is called force. Thus from Newton's first law we get qualitative definition of force. According to Newton's first law, a force is that which acting on a body at rest produces or tends to produce motion or acting on a moving body changes or tends to change its state of motion.</p> <h2>3.2 Nature Of Force Contact Force:</h2> <p>We are familiar with different types of force in our daily lives. Nature of them is of different types. Some of them are produced due to direct contact between two bodies. In addition, there are some forces which do not need direct contact between two bodies.</p> <p>The force which needs direct contact between two bodies to be created is defined as contact force. \n",

Since this force is the consequence of the direct contact between the hand and the body. The examples of contact forces are- frictional force, pulling force and the force created during collision. When a body tends to move or move over another body, then a resistive frictional force is produced against the motion between the contact surfaces of two bodies. Here the frictional force is produced due to direct contact between the surfaces of the two bodies.</p> <p>We apply pulling force on a box when we pull it over the floor. At that time frictional force is produced opposite to the motion of the box.</p> <h2>Non-Contact Force:</h2> <p>The force which acts without direct contact between two bodies is called non-contact force. The attractive gravitational force between two bodies, the attractive or repulsive electric force between two charged bodies, the attractive or repulsive force between two poles of two magnets, the force of attraction acting between a magnet and a magnetic material are the examples of non-contact force or distant force.</p> <p>Do yourself: Release a pen or pencil or any object from your hand.</p> <p>The body will fall down.

The force of gravitation is a non-contact force. Any two body of the universe exert force of gravitation on each other.</p> <p>When the earth exerts force of gravitation on another body, then this force is called gravity. Though we observe different kinds of force in nature, fundamental force are of four types. Rest of them is some forms of these fundamental forces. The forces which are root or independent i.e. the forces which are not produced from some other forces or not any forms of some other forces are called fundamental forces. Instead, other forces are some forms of these fundamental forces.</p> <p>The four fundamental forces which exist in nature are: 1. Force of gravitation 2. Electromagnetic force 3. Weak nuclear force 4. Strong nuclear force</p> <h2>Force Of Gravitation:</h2> <p>In this universe every body attracts each other by a force towards them. The mutual attraction between any two bodies of the universe is called gravitation. This attraction occurs due to mass of the bodies. The force of gravitation is comparatively weak among the fundamental forces. Weight of us is the consequence of gravitation.

This force may be of both types- attractive or repulsive. When the charged particles are at rest, only electric force works between them. The magnetic force is created simultaneously in addition to the electric force between the particles when the charged particles are mobile. The force of attraction or repulsion between two magnetic poles is also electromagnetic force. The electric force acting between two charged fundamental particles is more powerful than the force of gravitation between them. Nevertheless, electric force is of medium type considering strength. Frictional force, spring force etc. are produced due to electric forces between the charged particles.</p> <h2>Weak Nuclear Force</h2> <p>The short range and small magnitude force that exists between the fundamental particles within the nucleus is called weak nuclear force. Due to this force the nucleus becomes unstable and beta decay occurs. Most of the radioactive disintegration occurs due to weak nuclear force. The range of this force is less than 1016 m.</p> <h2>Strong Nuclear Force</h2> <p>It is known that there are two particles namely proton and neutron within the nucleus of an atom. These particles are called nucleon. The strong force that exists between two nucleons within the nucleus of an atom is called strong nuclear force. This force bounds the nucleons together. The strong nuclear force is responsible for the stability of the nucleus. This force is very short range and attractive. \n",

The forces that produce this balanced condition are called balanced forces.</p> <p>It is seen in figure 3.1 that an object is suspended with a thread. The force of attraction of earth on the object i.e. the weight of the object W is acting vertically downward. The tension of the thread T is acting vertically upward. Here the two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction thus canceling each other's action and producing a balanced condition.</p> <p>Only the attractive force of the earth i.e. the force of gravity will act on the object if the thread is cut.</p> <p>Then the object will fall down with acceleration due to gravity. Here, the force of gravity or weight of the object is the unbalanced force. If the body is displaced slightly along one side, the tension of the thread T and the weight W will not be in a straight line. Then a resultant force will act on the body without creating balanced condition. Due to this, the body will oscillate. \n",

If the handkerchief does not move then it is understood that either the team are applying equal amount of force and the rope or the handkerchief is in balanced condition.

Momentum depends on the mass and velocity of the body. Think about a loaded truck and a private car. You have to stop both the cars within the same distance. Which car needs hard brake to stop? The answer is truck. Though the truck and the car are moving with the same speed, the truck possesses that physical quantity which is more is its momentum.</p> <p>Momentum is a measure of how difficult it is to stop something that is moving.

A force can cause a moving object to change its velocity or direction of motion.</p> <p>A batsman hits the cricket ball coming from opposite direction during a game of cricket. Due to the hit, the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the ball change. The ball moves in a different direction due to this hit by the bat. In this case too, the ball has acceleration.</p> <h2>Effect Of Forces On Shape</h2> <p>There are many examples around us where the shape of a body changes by the application of force. The shape of an empty plastic bottle changes when it is pressed. Again when a rubber band is stretched by pulling it, it becomes narrow and its shape changes.</p> <p>Sometimes, the changes of shape of the bodies are temporary in nature. Sometimes, the shape of the object is permanently changed due to the application of force.

Take a marble and roll it on the floor. When you roll the marble, you apply a force on it. As a result, the marble becomes mobile on the ground. According to Newton's law the marble should remain in uniform velocity. In practice, it is seen that the marble comes to rest after traversing a small distance. This happens due to the friction of the floor. When the marble is in motion on the floor, a frictional force is developed due to the mutual friction between the marble and the floor. This force acts in the direction opposite to the motion and hinders the motion. If the friction of the floor was absent, then the marble would continue its perpetual motion with uniform velocity.</p> <p>When a body moves or tends to move over another body, then a resistance is developed between the two surfaces in contact, which is known as friction. \n",

The question arises- why friction occur? Friction is the result of the surface irregularities of any two surfaces. Each object has a surface. Again, the surface may be smooth or rough. Apparently, the surface of an object seems to be smooth, but it is observed that there are high and low grooves on it when viewed by a microscope [Figure 3.8]. When an object moves on another object, then the grooves of the two surfaces in contact catch onto one another. As a result of which the motion of one surface over another surface gets obstacled.</p> <p>As the grooves of a surface deepend and their number increases i.e. as the surface become rougher, the motion of one surface over another becomes more obstructed. Then the magnitude of frictional force also increases. The body becomes mobile if it can overcome the resistance of the surface in contact. \n",

When a massive body on a floor is pulled by a force but it does not move, then the frictional force created is called force of static friction. The static frictional force is developed opposite to the applied force and acts until motion is produced. When two bodies at rest are in contact with one another and one body is made to move on the other body, the friction produced between them until a relative motion is created is called static friction.</p> <h2>Sliding Friction</h2> <p>Sliding friction is friction where an object slides, or rubs against, another surface.</p> <p>We fall down and traverse a small distance when we move in a slippery road. \n",
            "Chunk 123:\n",
            " When a hard brake is applied on a car moving fast, the car does not stop rather cross a small distance by sliding.</p> <h2>Rolling Friction</h2> <p>Rolling friction is friction between a rolling object and the surface that it is rolling on. The wheel's motion of a cycle, motion of marble is example of rolling friction.</p> <p>During travelling we use luggage carrier having wheels to carry goods. If there was no wheel in the luggage carrier then it was too difficult to pull it by sliding from one place to another. Due to the attachment of wheel it becomes easier to pull it i.e. the force of rolling friction is less than that of the static friction.</p> <h2>Fluid Friction</h2> <p>When an object moves in a fluid i.e. a liquid or gas, the friction acts is called fluid friction.</p> <p>We have to overcome a barrier in water while swimming in the pond. This barrier is the fluid friction. A parachute works by harnessing the air resistance. The air resistance is a type of frictional force which works against the force of gravity of the earth. As an open parachute has a large surface area, it helps provide enough air resistance. As a result, the sky-diver's falling speed is decreased mostly. So, the skydiver will then be able to descend slowly and safely.</p> <h2>3.10 Effects Of Friction On Motion</h2> <p>Friction has enormous influence on the motion of an object. \n",
            "Chunk 124:\n",
            " Friction is a kind of resistive force which slows down the motion of a body.</p> <p>Though friction creates many problems in our daily lives, it plays a vital role for movement and vehicle operaration. In this section we shall discuss about tyre's surface, smoothness of road and role of friction for controlling motion.</p> <p><img alt=\"66_image_0.png\" src=\"66_image_0.png\" /></p> <h2>Tyre'S Surface</h2> <p>Driving vehicles is possible because of the friction between the tyres and the road surface. The friction force between the tyres and the road depends on condition of the tyres and surface of the road. It also depends on the weight of the vehicle. The tyre's rubber surface is designed with treads i.e. grooves or teeth. The tyre surface is up and down due to these grooves. If the tyre is new, these grooves are distinct; as a result the force of friction between the tyre and the road is maximum. When the tyre becomes old, their grooves are worn out and the surface becomes flat. As a result the frictional force between the tyre and the road decreased mostly. Say, what inconvenience may arise due to this.</p> <h2>Smoothness Of Road</h2> <p>The smoothness of road has a great impact on the motion of a body. When the road is smooth, movement of vehicles on the road becomes easier and the journey becomes comfortable. \n",
            "Chunk 125:\n",
            " As the road becomes smoother, the resistive force of friction becomes lesser. The magnitude of the frictional force between the car's tyre and the road depends on the smoothness of the tyre as well as on the smoothness of the road. Many types of problems arise when amount of the frictional force is decreased largely. So, the road should not be too smooth. If the road is too smooth, it is not possible to stop the car within a certain distance in spite of applying brake. The friction is important for the motion of a car. If the road is too smooth, the necessary reaction force is not produced.</p> <p>The amount of the frictional force is largely reduced when the road is too smooth, as a result the car will not be able to move forward. So, the smoothness of the road will be such that it can supply the necessary frictional force.</p> <h2>Controlling Motion And Braking Force</h2> <p>The speed of the vehicle has to increase or decrease according to the necessity at the time of vehicle movement. That is, we have to control the motion of a vehicle.</p> <p>Brake is such an arrangement, which controls the speed of the car or rotation of the wheels according to the necessity by increasing the friction. With this it is possible to halt a vehicle in a certain place. When the driver applies the brakes, the shoe or pad made of asbestos press the metallic disc on the wheel. The friction between the pad and disc slows down the wheel's speed. \n",
            "Chunk 126:\n",
            " As a result, the velocity of a car decreases.</p> <h2>3.11 Increasing And Decreasing Friction</h2> <p>Friction is inextricably related to our daily lives. Friction can be increased in necessity; again friction can be decreased too in necessity. How friction can be decrease and increase would be discussed in this section.</p> <h2>Reducing Friction Smoothing The Surface</h2> <p>Friction makes many troubles to displace one body from one place to another. Let, you want to displace a massive box on the floor. If the friction of the contact surface is large enough, then it takes a lot of labor to displace it. By polishing or smoothing the surface it can be decreased.</p> <h2>Using Wheels</h2> <p>There are wheels in bus, truck and many types of machinery. The wheel is an ingenious invention. Its circular shape reduces friction to a minimum. Without wheel was it possible to use this machinery? Using wheel in a suitcase reduces the friction and it becomes easier to pull it. The value of the rolling friction in comparison to the sliding friction is reduced greatly due to the attachment of wheels.</p> <h2>Using Lubricants</h2> <p>Oil, mobil and grease like materials are called lubricants or greasy materials in short. A layer of lubricant between the two surfaces can greatly reduce the friction. So, lubricants are used between the moving parts of an engine. \n",
            "Chunk 127:\n",
            " In addition, we use oil in sewing machine, lock and hinges.</p> <h2>Using Ball Bearings</h2> <p>Another important invention similar to the wheel is the invention of ball bearing. It was possible to reduce the friction greatly between the surfaces by using ball bearing. Ball bearings are the small, smooth metal balls. Generally these are made of steel. Ball bearings are placed between the moving parts of a machine. They roll around so that the moving parts of the machine do not rub against each other directly. That is, the surfaces roll over one another instead of sliding and friction reduces. There are uses of ball bearing in car's wheel, cycle and electric fan [Figure 3.10].</p> <p><img alt=\"68_image_0.png\" src=\"68_image_0.png\" /></p> <h2>Increasing Friction Driving Cars</h2> <p>Without friction in the road, the tyres of a car will just spin around at the same spot. Possibly you have seen how truck and bus is blocked in a slippery or muddy road in the rainy days. What is the reason behind this? This is due to the large decrease in friction. So friction is to be increased according to the necessity. The car tyres are so designed that they are able to grip the road properly and create necessary frictional force.</p> <p>Therefore the surface of the tyres are designed with treads i.e. grooves and teeth. In the rainy days, the water or mud enters the grooves and water and mud are thrown outside boldly. \n",
            "Chunk 128:\n",
            " As a result, the tyres are able to grip the road surface well. i.e. friction can be increased by making the surface rough.</p> <h2>Mountain Climbing</h2> <p>Mountain climbers need to grip the rock or mountain surface with their hands and feet, in order to climb a mountain. They use chalk powder to grip the rock. There are spikes under the boot of players so that they do not fall down while running.</p> <h2>3.12 Friction: A Necessary Evil</h2> <p>Though friction has many disadvantages it is considered as a necessary evil. What causes it? We cannot do anything without the force of friction. If there was no friction, the motion of a body would not cease at all and continue perpetually. Due to friction, a nail is fixed in a wall. It became possible to construct buildings and houses because of friction. Friction has made it possible to write on a paper with a pencil or a pen. We can walk as there is a friction between our shoes and the ground. We can change the direction of motion of a car owing to friction. Using a parachute it is possible to descend safely to the ground by harnessing the air resistance. In spite of having so many advantages we have to suffer a lot for friction. Because of excess friction the vehicles cannot move easily. Any device that has moving parts can wear out and tear due to friction. In any type of vehicles- may be car, boat or airplane, extra fuel has to be spent to overcome the excess friction. Fuel energy is being wasted because of friction. The energy that is wasted for friction mainly appears as heat energy. \n",
            "Chunk 129:\n",
            " Not only that energy is converted to heat due to friction, but also the parts of an engine may be overheated. As a result of friction, the soles of your shoes wear and tear out. So to make the life and works easier we need friction but excess friction is the cause of many losses too. Therefore to produce the necessary friction, we have to control it. Sometimes we need to increase or decrease friction by some processes. Therefore, we cannot discard friction totally; also friction is beneficial to us in many cases. For this reason friction is called a necessary evil.</p> <p>Preparing report Present a report to your teacher about the positive impact of friction in our life in the light of section 3.9 to 3.12.

In science the term work represents a definite concept. A gateman guards a house all day long sitting at a place and can say he has done his work. A boat was floating with the current of a river or canal and Mr. Karim was pulling it back. He might say he has done work to hold the boat otherwise the current of the river could pull it away. These are recognized as work in our daily life but these are not work in the point of view of science. Rather had the gateman guarded the house walking instead of sitting or had the boat floated with the current of the river, work could have been done. The concept of work in science is different from that of daily life. In fact in science work is done when displacement is associated with force. So, if a force acts on a body and causes its displacement only then work is said to be done. We see many examples of work around us in our daily life. \n",

We can apply force to shift a body from one place to another. We can change the shape of any body by applying force. In these cases work is done. If a construction laborer wants to get to the second floor of a building with ten bricks, he has to do more work than that of lifting a single brick to the same place as he has to use more force. He has to do more work if he wants to lift those brick on the third floor. Therefore, the amount of work depends on the applied force and the distance. Work is measured by the product of applied force on a body and its displacement along the direction of force. \n",

This principle is applicable within the sphere of influence of conservative force such Fig: 4.4 as electric force, magnetic force, spring force etc. This sphere of influence is called the field of that force such as gravitational field, electric field etc. We work against the force of gravity when we lift m t anything higher from the ground.

We need to have clear idea about the sources of energy to save the living beings and to continue the supply of energy. We know that the sun is the only source of all energy. Moreover, the nuclear energy in the nucleus and the energy from the hot melted substances are considered to be the sources of energy. All the existing energy of the world is directly or indirectly comes from the sun or are produced using the radiation of the sun.</p> <h2>Chemical Energy/Fuel Energy:</h2> <p>Man in the ancient time was dependent wholly on the energy of their muscles. Afterwards, they learnt to tame the wild animals and use their energy in different work. They used to carry their goods and cultivate land with the help of animals. The initial stage of civilization was to produce heat energy from burning wood and leaves and mechanical energy from current of water and flow of wind. The economic development of human being begins from the use of machine energy. Industrial revolution and invention of steam engine reduced men's dependence on muscle energy of human and animals. Man kept operating different machines with the help of steam energy. Fuel is necessary to produce this steam energy. So we consider different kinds of fuels to be the sources of energy.</p> <p>The most common sources of energy are coal, mineral oil and natural gas. Coal, mineral oil and natural gas from underground are used as fuel directly or by refining them slightly.</p> <p>Coal: Coal is best known to us as one of the sources of energy. \n",

Due to different natural calamities and natural consequences the leaves of the trees and their stems were buried underneath the earth and began to coagulate. As a result of chemical changes, the leaves of the trees and stems were transformed into coal. Combustion of coal gives us heat directly. This is a well known fuel. Many essential substances can be produced from coal apart from using it as a fuel. Some of the coal products are coal gas, tar, benzene, ammonia, toluene etc. Coal is used to cook food and to drive the steam engines. In modern age, the main use of coal is in thermal power plants. The main fuel in a thermal power station is coal.</p> <p>The main problem of a coal fueled power station is that it emits sulphur smog which causes acid rain. Though this acid is very weak, it kills the fishes of pond, cannel and lake, destroys forest and damages the sculptures of stone.</p> <h2>Mineral Oil:</h2> <p>Petroleum or mineral oil is one of the principal sources of energy. It is widely used as a fuel in the present world. It is being used right from a rural cottage to the most modern transport system. Petrol, pitch that is used to pave roads, kerosene and chemical fertilizers are all petroleum products. There is nothing like petrol to be used as fuel. On the other hand, many kinds of artificial fabrics can be developed from petroleum. These are terry line, polyester, cashmilon etc. \n",

Petroleum is a Latin word. It is a combination of two minor words: Petro and Olium. In Latin language 'petro' means stone and 'olium' means oil. So, petroleum means oil of stones i.e. oil stored inside stones. In tertiary age i.e. almost five to six crores of years ago the trees and the animals fell buried in the different layers of sedimentary rock on the bottom of the sea. Due to different chemical changes these were transformed into mineral oil. Most of the solid regions of the present world were a part of the bottom region of the sea in prehistoric age.</p> <h2>Natural Gas:</h2> <p>Natural gas is a well known source of energy. Specially, the use of natural gas in Bangladesh is wider. Use of natural gas is very high in all advanced countries. It is also used in different industries as fuel. In Bangladesh it is widely used for domestic requirement basically for cooking purposes. It is also used in fertilizer factories. Heat energy is produced by the combustion of gas and electric energy is produced from heat energy in a thermal power station.</p> <p>Natural gas is obtained from underneath the earth. Digging very deep well the gas may be taken out from underneath the earth. Tremendous temperature and pressure inside the earth is the root cause of the creation of the gas. Natural gas is also available in petroleum well. The principal element in a natural gas is the methane gas. These are called fossil energy. \n",

So men are looking for alternate sources of energy of which solar energy, energy from water flow, energy from tide and ebb, geothermal energy, wind energy, biomass etc are the main sources. These sources are directly or indirectly dependent on the sun. As long as earth receives sunlight the energy supply from these sources is possible. These are called renewable sources.</p> <h2>Solar Energy:</h2> <p>The energy that we obtain from the sun is called Solar Energy. It is known to all that the sun is the source of all energy. The origin of all forms of energy is from the solar energy in one way or the other. For an example, the fossil fuel such as coal, mineral, oil, and natural gas is actually a store of solar energy for a long time.</p> <p>From ancient times man is using sunlight directly to dry things. At present man is adopting various means to use the solar energy round the clock. Ignition can be done by concentrating sun's rays- with the help of a convex lens. Solar cooker consists of a metallic bowl on which the solar rays are reflected. The cooker can be used in cooking purposes.</p> <p>Do it yourself: Take a concave mirror with a focal length of 15cm or 20cm. Hold the mirror facing the sun. \n",

The method of producing hydroelectricity using the water current is simple. The current of water is used to rotate a turbine. A co-ordination of mechanical and magnetic energy is possible from the rotation of turbines.</p> <p>Electricity produced by mechanical energy created by water current in co-ordination of magnetic energy is called hydroelectricity.</p> <p>| Making a model: Make a model of                | a   | |------------------------------------------------|-----| | hydroelectric station that uses the energy of  |     | | falling water to turn a turbine to operate a   |     | | dynamo to produce hydroelectricity.

Kinetic energy due to the air flow can be transferred into electric energy. The machine that transforms energy is called Windmill. People in the ancient time used to lift water from well, sail ship using the wind blow. Still today people sail in the boat using air energy. Nowadays electric energy is produced using windmill with the help of technology.</p> <h2>Geo-Thermal Energy</h2> <p>The heat in the earth can be used as the source of energy. The heat in the deep of earth is so high that it can melt pieces of rocks. This melted rock is called Magma. This Magma sometimes rises up and remains stored just below the surface of the ground due to geological changes. These types of places are known as hot spot. When the water under the ground comes in contact with the hot spot it turns into steam which remains stored in the ground. This steam could be let out passing a pipe through a hole on the hot spot with the help of high pressure. Electricity can be produced rotating a turbine with the help of this steam. \n",

Biomass refers to all those organic materials that can transform into energy. Man along with other animals takes biomass as food and keeps their activities of life active by transforming biomass into energy. Biomass can be considered as a multiple source of energy. The organic substances that can be used as the source of energy are - plants and trees, dry wood, waste of wood, crops, husk of rice, herbs, waste of birds and animals, garbage etc. Biomass is mainly composed of Carbon and Hydrogen. One of the renewable sources of energy is biomass.</p> <p>Biogas can be produced easily from biomass. We can use this gas as the alternate to natural gas and use for cooking even for the production of electricity. The production of biogas is very simple. If we keep cow dung and water in 1:2 ratio in a closed pot for dumping, biogas will be produced. This gas comes out through a tube. This gas is used for cooking. For the cooking and lighting bulbs for a family of 4/5 persons the requirement of gas can be supplied from the cow dung of only 2/3 cows.</p> <h2>Nuclear Energy</h2> <p>Electricity can be produced by using the energy produced in nuclear reaction.

The waste of nuclear fuel is extremely radioactive and so it has to be preserved for thousands of years to make it safe. Moreover, in a nuclear reactor high temperature and pressure is produced. So it has to be made of such a material that can tolerate the high temperature and pressure. Any nuclear accident is very dangerous which we can realize from the accidents of Chernobyl in Soviet Union (at present Ukraine) and Fukushima in Japan. In nuclear power production less greenhouse gas is released in the environment.</p> <p>The Social Effects and Advantages of Renewable Energy Uses of renewable energy have a far-reaching effect on our social life.

Fill the whole tube with pure mercury. Close the open end of the tube tightly with finger and invert the tube. Take this inverted end of the tube along with your finger inside the pure mercury contained in a container. Now remove the finger and take necessary steps to keep the tube vertical. It will be observed that the mercury has come down to some extent and has attained a steady position. It might appear apparently that the mercury inside the tube is in standing position by itself. But in reality it is not so. It happens so due to air pressure. Atmosphere is always exerting pressure on the mercury of the container. This pressure is convoyed through the mercury and acts in the upward direction in the tube. This very pressure holds the mercury column of the tube. In absence of this pressure the mercury of the tube will come down due to the force of gravity. Therefore, atmospheric pressure is equal to the pressure of the mercury column of the tube. Generally the height of the mercury column that remains in the tube in about 76cm i.e. the air pressure supports the pressure of 76cm column of mercury. \n",
            "Chunk 183:\n",
            " In this way using the height of a liquid the atmospheric pressure can be measured. The space that remains just above the mercury column in the tube up to its closed end is totally empty. This empty space is termed as Torricelli's vacuum. Only a scarce amount of mercury vapor exists there. The apparatus used to measure the air pressure is called barometer.</p> <h2>5.4: Altitude And Atmospheric Pressure</h2> <p>The atmospheric pressure depends on the density and height of the atmosphere. On the earth's surface and on sea level the normal air pressure is 76cm of mercury pressure. With the increase of altitude from the sea-level the weight and density of air-column decreases. So, the air pressure reduces with the increase of height. The atmospheric pressure on the peak of Mount Everest is about 30% of the sea-level air pressure. For this reason</p> <p><img alt=\"95_image_1.png\" src=\"95_image_1.png\" /></p> <p>Figur: 5.4 respiration becomes difficult at such a high level. There is a possibility of bleeding from the nose at high altitude as atmospheric pressure is considerably low there. Nowadays normal pressure is kept inside a plane for the convenience of the passengers when it flies at a very high altitude and low pressure region. With the increase of height from the earth's surface the pressure of the atmosphere decreases. \n",

It indicates the possibility of rain. 2. All of a sudden if the mercury height falls down then it is to be realized that the atmospheric pressure of the surrounding area has fallen down and low pressure has been created. The air at a high pressure from the neighboring area will rush with tremendous speed to the depression area. So, there is a possibility of storm. 3. When the height of the mercury column of the barometer slowly increases, then it indicates that water vapor from the air is being disappeared and dry air is occupying that space. So, the weather will remain dry and clear. \n",

Tie the body by a light thread and dip it into a container completely filled with water. Some water will spill out of the vessel. Take the weight of the body in completely submersed condition. Now find out the apparent loss of weight by subtracting the weight of the body immersed in water from the known weight of the body in air. Now determine the weight of the spilled out water. It will be observed that the apparent loss of weight of the body is equal to the weight of the displaced liquid. Thus we may have a proof of Archimedes' principle in a simple way.

Pascal stated a law about this transmission of pressure.</p> <p>Pascal's law: External pressure applied to any portion of a liquid or a gas enclosed in a container is equally transmitted in all directions in the liquid or the gas without any trace of diminution and acts perpendicularly on the surface of the container in contact with the liquid or gas.</p> <p>Mathematical explanation of Pascal's law: principle of multiplications of force On any portion of a confined liquid if force is applied by a smaller piston, then forces of greater magnitudes are exerted on the pistons of greater cross sectional area. This is known as principle of multiplication of force.</p> <p>Let, C1 and C2 be two cylinders (Fig:5.10) and A1 Figur: 5.10</p> <p><img alt=\"99_image_0.png\" src=\"99_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>and A2 be their cross sectional areas respectively. The two cylinders are connected by a pipe. There is an air tight piston in each cylinder. The two cylinders are filled up with a liquid. Now a force F applied to the smaller piston generates a pressure Fy/A1. According to Pascal's law this pressure is transmitted in all directions through the liquid. \n",
            "Chunk 193:\n",
            " Therefore the upward pressure exerted on the larger piston is F /A1. Because of this pressure, the larger piston experiences an upward force equal to (F 1/A1) × A2.

As soon as the tape is released of the tension it regains its original length or tends to get back its previous length. Here pull means application of force and elongation in length means deformation. Actually as deformation of a body occurs, a resistive force generates within the body for which it tends to get back its original size and shape.</p> <p>Elasticity is defined as the attributed property by which a body is able to resist deformation, either in shape or in volume or both and recovers its original shape and size when the deforming force is removed. \n",
            "Chunk 194:\n",
            " The substances which possess this property are called elastic substances. There is a certain limit of the deforming force and if the force applied exceeds the limit the body then unable to regain its previous shape and size. This limit of applied force is termed as elastic limit. The molecules of a substance move away form each other when external force is applied on elastic bodies. Original length, volume or size and shape of a body are changed due to this applied deforming force. The change per unit length or per unit volume of an object is called strain. Whenever an external force deforms a body, an internal resistive force will develop inside the body due to its elastic property. This opposing force comes into play to resist the applied external force. This developed internal restoring force acting perpendicularly per unit area of the body is called strain.</p> <p>Hooke's law: Scientist Robert Hooke invented the basic law of elasticity. According to this law- within elastic limit stress is directly proportional to strain. Mathematically we may write, stress ∞ strain .'. stress = constant × strain.</p> <p>This constant is called the modulus of elasticity of the material of the body. Strain has no unit. The unit of stress is Nm2. The unit of modulus of elasticity is also Nm2.</p> <p>5.12.

Again attraction and repulsion forces are present among the molecules of a solid and this is the cause for the generation of potential energy. Among the gaseous molecules attraction-repulsion force does not exist and so there is no potential energy. The sum of the kinetic and potential energy of the molecules of a substance is called its internal energy. Evidently a part of the internal energy originates from kinetic energy and the other part from potential energy. If thermal energy is applied to a body then its internal energy will increase.

In solids the molecules vibrate with enhance energy against the intermolecular force and as a result the displacements of the molecules from their equilibrium position increase. But during displacement of a molecule from its equilibrium position a force of attraction is exerted on it. When the molecule tends to go near to its neighboring molecules then a repulsive force acts on it.</p> <p>Again with the increase of intermolecular distance a force of attraction acts on the molecule. For the increase in temperature the molecules of a solid vibrate but it is not a simple harmonic oscillation. Because, if the distance between two molecules is lessened than the distance in their equilibrium position then the repulsive force increases rapidly.</p> <p>But as the distance between two molecules relative to their equilibrium position increases, then the attractive force increases. But it does not happen as quickly as in the case of repulsive force. As a result due to increase of temperature when the molecules of a body vibrate at a random fashion they approach further towards the exterior than towards the interior. As such the average equilibrium position of each molecule gets displaced towards the exterior and the body expands. Since intermolecular force is less in liquids, expansion due to heat is more in it. For gaseous substances with the increase of temperature the random motion of the molecules increases. The thermal expansion of gases is maximum. \n",

            " If gaps between the rails are not kept, the rail line will bend due to its expansion. Superficial expansion and coefficient of superficial expansion: The area of a solid  is increased with the increase of temperature. It is called superficial expansion. Let initial surface area of a solid at 01 temperature = A1 When the temperature is increased to 02 the final surface area = A2 - Increase in temperature = 02 - 01 And increase in area = A2 - A1 The coefficient of superficial expansion is expressed by the symbol ß A 2-A 1 .: Superficial expansion, ß = . ... ...

So, the increase in surface area of 1m2 surface area of a solid for the rise of temperature 1K is called the coefficient of superficial expansion of the material of that solid. Its unit is K-1. \n",

It means that if the temperature of a copper body is increased through 1K, then the increase in surface area of copper is 33.4 × 106 m2.</p> <h2>Volume Expansion And Coefficient Of Volume Expansion:</h2> <p>The volume of a solid substance increases if its temperature is increased. It is called volume expansion. Let, the initial volume of a substance be V ; and initial temperature be 01. When the temperature is raised to 02, its volume becomes V2 after being increased. There increase in volume is V2 - V1 and increase of temperature = 02 - 01.</p> <p>Now if the coefficient of volume expansion is represented by y, then ... ...

The relations among a, ß and y are as follow: y = 3α and β = 2α</p> <h2>6.7 Expansion Of Liquids:</h2> <p>Liquids have no definite length or area. But it has definite volume. If the temperature is increased its volume increases. So, the expansion of liquid means the expansion in volume of the liquid. The rates of increase in volume of all the liquids are not the same. Different liquids having the same volume expand differently for the same rise of temperature.</p> <h2>Experiment:</h2> <p>A number of long necked glass bulbs of equal volume and size are taken. Equal volume of water, alcohol, kerosene, ether etc are taken in these bulbs (fig 6.8). Now water at room temperature is taken in a comparatively larger vessel and the bulbs are placed vertically in it. The upper level of Fig: 6.8</p> <p><img alt=\"110_image_1.png\" src=\"110_image_1.png\" /></p> <p>the liquids in all the bulbs will be the same. Now some hot water is poured into the vessel. \n",

            " After some time the bulbs will attain a higher temperature and it will be seen in the stem of the bulbs the upper level of different liquids are not at the same height rather their heights are different. So, it is understood that the volumes of different liquids of same volume expand differently for a definite increase of temperature.</p> <h2>6.8 Real And Apparent Expansion Of Liquids</h2> <p>Liquid always has to be heated keeping it in a container. The liquid as well as the container expand when heat is applied. So, the expansion of the liquid observed by us is not the real expansion but it is an apparent expansion. There are two types of expansions of liquidsa. Real expansion b. Apparent expansion Real expansion: If it had been possible to heat a liquid without keeping it in a vessel then the real expansion of the liquid that would be obtained is called real expansion of the liquid. But heating a liquid without a container is not possible. So, considering the expansion of the container the actual expansion of the liquid that is obtained is called the real expansion.</p> <p>It is expressed by Vr.</p> <h2>Apparent Expansion:</h2> <p>The expansion of liquid apparently observed without considering the expansion of the container is called the apparent expansion of liquid. It is denoted by Va.</p> <h2>Relation Between Real Expansion And Apparent Expansion:</h2> <p>A glass bulb with a long graduated stem is filled with liquid up to the mark A. \n",
            "Chunk 217:\n",
            " Now keeping an eye on the liquid column the bulb is heated and it is observed that the upper level of the liquid comes down from position A to position B. After that it moves up from the graduated line B crossing the mark A and reaches to mark C. The reason is that when heat is applied the volume of the bulb increases at first. Due to this cause liquid comes down to B from A. Later on as soon as the liguid gets heated its volume starts to increase and reaches from B to C. It happens so as the expansion of liquid is more than the expansion of solid. Apparently it appears to us that the liquid was at mark A and finally reaches to mark C. Therefore, CA is the apparent expansion. CB is the real expansion and AB indicates the expansion of the container. From figure it is observed that, CB = CA+AB or, Real expansion = Apparent expansion + expansion of the container .: Vr= Va + Vg ... ... ... (6.5)</p> <h2>6.9 Effect Of Heat On Change Of State:</h2> <p>Matter can exist in three states e.g. solid, liquid and gas. All of us know that water has three states-ice, water and vapor. These three states are called solid, liquid and gas. These states of water depend on air pressure and temperature.</p> <p><img alt=\"111_image_0.png\" src=\"111_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>A solid may be liquefied by applying heat. This process is called fusion. \n",
            "Chunk 218:\n",
            " At the beginning the temperature of a body rises with the application of heat and at one stage the temperature does not change even if more heat is applied. At this moment the amount of heat absorbed by a body is used to convert the solid into liquid only. If heat is applied to ice below 0°C, temperature will rise and reach at 0°C. After this if more heat is applied the temperature will not rise but the ice will begin to melt to water. The amount of heat absorbed during the conversion of a solid to liquid is used to break the intermolecular bond of the molecules. On further heating the temperature of water of 0°C starts to rise. At a stage, water starts vaporizing and the temperature remains unchanged. During this time water absorbs heat to become vapor. Here also the effect of heat is used to break the intermolecular bond among the liquid molecules. On the other way around, gaseous substance may be converted to liquid and liquid to solid by extracting heat from them. So, on the transformation of substances effect of heat is remarkable.</p> <h2>6.10 Fusion, Vaporization And Condensation: Fusion</h2> <p>To transform a substance from solid to liquid by applying heat is called fusion. The definite temperature at which a solid starts to melt is called its melting point. This temperature remains unchanged until all of the substance melts. Vaporization The phenomenon of transformation of a liquid from its liquid state to gaseous state is called vaporization. \n",

            " This vaporization may occur in two processesi) Evaporation ii) Boiling Evaporation The process in which a liquid at any temperature slowly changes from its free surface into vapor state is called evaporation.</p> <p>Activities: Take some water in a bowl and keep it at a corner of your room. Observe what happens to the water after one or two days. It will be observed that the water has been reduced.</p> <p>What is the cause for the reduction of this water? The water has been converted into vapor even at the room temperature and for this the amount of water has been lessened. This is called evaporation.</p> <h2>Boiling</h2> <p>The process in which a liquid is rapidly converted into vapor by increasing its temperature through application of heat is called boiling.</p> <p>The temperature at which boiling of liquid begins is called the boiling point of that liquid. The value of boiling point depends on pressure. Experiment: Pouring some water in a container and supplying heat the gradual increase of temperature would be observed. At a certain temperature the water will begin to boil and get converted into water vapor. It is called boiling. \n",

What do you observe? The pieces of ice have joined together. Why? As the pressure acts on the surface of contact of the two pieces of ice, the melting point goes down i.e. the melting point becomes less than 0℃. But the temperature of the surface of contact remains at 0℃. So, ice at the surface of contact melts. The required amount of heat needed for melting is collected from the ice. After the removal of pressure the melting point again becomes 0℃. As a result the water obtained from the fusion of ice at the surface of contact again freezes to ice. For this reason if pressure is applied then two pieces of ice unite together to form a single piece. To melt a solid substance into liquid by applying pressure and again to bring it back to the solid state by reducing the pressure is called regelation.</p> <p>The melting point of a substance changes due to the variation of pressure on the substance. \n",
            "Chunk 221:\n",
            " The changes of melting point may occur in two different ways for pressure.</p> <p>.</p> <p>The solid substances whose volumes contract on melting, their melting points reduce with the increase of pressure i.e. they melt at a lower temperature.</p> <p>.</p> <p>The solid substances whose volumes expand on melting, their melting points increase with the increase of pressure i.e. they melt at a higher temperature.</p> <p>6.12 Latent heat of fusion and latent heat of vaporization Latent heat of fusion: We know, when the temperature of a solid reaches the melting point due to application of heat then the temperature remain unchanged until all the substances transform into liquid. Here the amount of heat required to transform the solid into liquid is nothing but latent heat of fusion. This heat energy does not change the temperature but is used to loosen the intermolecular bond of the molecules of the substances.</p> <p>Latent heat of vaporization: If heat is applied to a liquid and its temperature reaches at the boiling point then whatever amount of heat is applied the temperature will remain unchanged until all the liquid is converted into vapor state. Here the amount of heat required to convert the liquid into vapor state is called latent heat of vaporization.</p> <h2>Evaporation Produces Cooling:</h2> <p>In summer days the water kept in a new earthen pitcher becomes cold. Uncountable numbers of pores are there on the body of an earthen pitcher. Through these pores water seeps out and evaporates. \n",

Less the boiling point of a liquid, more would be the rate of evaporation. The rate of evaporation of volatile substances is maximum.</p> <p>Pressure on the liquid: The rate of evaporation decreases with the increase of atmospheric pressure on the liquid. The rate of evaporation increases with the decrease of pressure. The rate of evaporation in vacuum is maximum.</p> <p>Liquid and the temperature of the air in contact with the liquid: If the temperature of the air in contact with the liquid increases then the rate of evaporation will increase. \n",

Observe that the movement or the vibration of the hand is from left to right or from top to motion of wave bottom but the motion of wave is horizontal. Here the up direction of vibration of the particles is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of wave. This very wave is transverse wave. So we can say that the wave which moves down perpendicularly to the direction of vibration of the particles Figure: 7.4 is called transverse wave. Water wave is an example of transverse wave.</p> <p><img alt=\"120_image_0.png\" src=\"120_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>A spring is set as in the figure 7.5. Now let's move our hand forward and backward by holding the free end of the spring. When we move the hand forward a flow of contraction will be created in the spring. Again if we move the hand backward, a flow of rarefaction will be created in the spring. The flow of contraction and rarefaction continues to move forward. \n",

            " In this case the movement of hand and the wave moves in the same direction. That means, the direction of vibration of the spring and the motion of wave are parallel to each other. So we can say that the wave that travels in a direction parallel to the direction of vibration of the particles of the medium is known as longitudinal wave. The sound wave in the air medium is an example of longitudinal wave.</p> <p>The highest and the lowest point of a transverse wave are called wave crest and wave trough. The similar quantities in the longitudinal wave are contraction and rarefaction.</p> <h2>7.3 Wave Related Quantities Complete Vibration:</h2> <p>If a wave transmitting particle moves from a certain point and again comes back to the same point then the motion is called complete vibration.</p> <p><img alt=\"120_image_1.png\" src=\"120_image_1.png\" /></p> <p>Figure: 7.6</p> <h2>Time Period:</h2> <p>The time interval in which the wave is repeated that is the times required for one complete vibration of a wave transmitting particle is known as its time period. \n",

Wave is produced from a vibrating object. So the frequency of vibrating object is equal to the frequency of the wave. The unit of frequency is Hertz (Hz). If a vibrating particle executes one complete vibration in one second then its frequency is called 1 Hz. It is expressed by 'f'. The relation between frequency and l time period is f =</p> <h2>Amplitude:</h2> <p>To produce a wave the particles need to vibrate about their equilibrium position.

            " This power is circulated through wave. Sound wave is a longitudinal wave. During the circulation of this wave, the detraction and expansion of the substance are created (Fig 7.9).This sound wave makes a sense of hearing in our ear by being circulated from the medium. It is noticeable that the sound is not created without Figure: 7.9 vibration. When tune-pin copper, bowl, the bell of school is ringing, you will understand that they are vibrating if you touch them. When you speak, you will see that your throat is vibrating.</p> <p>Activities: Take water in a brass bowl. Strike the bowl. You can hear sound. Small waves are seen on the water. Now hold the bowl by your hand. Can you hear sound now? Is there any wave in water?</p> <p>As long as the bowl produces sound it continues its vibration.</p> <p>So, small waves are produced in water. While the vibration of the bowl stops, the sound stops, so does the wave. So it is understood that a vibrating object can produce sound. But it does not mean that any vibration of any object can produce audible sound. \n",

So, sound is called a mechanical wave. Since the direction of propagation of wave and of particles are in the same direction, so is longitudinal. The velocity of sound wave depends on the nature of the medium. The velocity of sound in gaseous medium is less, high in liquid and higher in solid. The intensity of sound wave is directly to the square of its amplitude. So higher the amplitude, the higher is the intensity.</p> <p>Reflection, refraction and superposition are possible in case of sound wave. The velocity of sound wave depends on the temperature and the humidity of medium too.</p> <h2>7.6 Echo</h2> <p>If anyone produces a sound standing near the bank of a river, many of us have the experience of hearing the repetition of that sound after a while. The same case happens if we produce sound standing near a hill or a building. If a sound is produced in a big empty house, the same sound is heard just after a while. These phenomena take place due to the reflection of sound. \n",
            "Chunk 242:\n",
            " When a sound becomes separate from its original sound and is repeated due to reflection then this reflected sound is called echo. Simply we can say that the reflection of sound is echo.</p> <h2>The Minimum Distance Of Reflector</h2> <p>A sound that is heard persists 0.1 second in our brain. It is called the persistence period of hearing. If any new sound reaches our ear in this period we cannot hear it. Therefore for hearing an echo of any sound the distance between the source of sound and reflector must be such that the reflected wave cannot come back to the listener before a time of 0.1 second. If the velocity of sound in the air at 0℃ is considered to be 332ms 1 then in 0.1 sec sound can travel 33.2 m. Therefore a reflector must be placed at a minimum distance of 33.2/2 or 16.6 m from the listener.</p> <p>Now tell why echo is not heard in a small house?</p> <h2>7.7 Uses Of Echo Determination Of The Depth Of A Well:</h2> <p>Depth of water surface of a well can be very easily determined by means of echo. When a sound is produced at the mouth of the well, it being reflected from its water surface heard in the form of</p> <p><img alt=\"123_image_1.png\" src=\"123_image_1.png\" /></p> <p>echo. The time between the production of sound and the hearing of echo is determined by means of a stopwatch. \n",

            " Let, depth of well = h the time difference between the production of sound and hearing of echo = t Speed of sound = v Now the distance travelled by reflected sound to the listener is 2h.</p> <p>Therefore, 2h = V × t or, h = \" x t If the depth of the well is less than 16.6m, it will not be possible to perform this experiment as it is based on echo.</p> <p>In the same way this method can also be used to find mineral substances in the earth.</p> <p>Flying of bat: Figure: 7.12</p> <p><img alt=\"124_image_0.png\" src=\"124_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>Bat flies using the echo of sound as it cannot see. Bat can produce and hear ultrasonic sound. We cannot hear ultrasonic sound. Bat produces ultrasonic sound and spread it forward which reflects back to the bat from a reflector. Bat can understand from the reflected sound if there is any object before it. It hunts its prey using this technique. If the sound does not reflect back then it can understand that there is open space and it flies that way. Sometimes the bat fails to detect the position of wires of electric lines and flies through the parallel wires and gets stuck and becomes dead as soon as the positive and negative electric lines get connected with its body. \n",

The distance travelled by sound in one second is called velocity of sound. The velocity of sound depends on some factors.</p> <p>Nature of medium: Velocity of sound in different media is different. For example velocity of sound in air, water and iron is different. At 20℃ the velocity of sound in air is 344ms1, in water it is 1450ms ' and in iron it is 5130ms1. Generally we can see the velocity of sound in air is less, in liquid it is higher and highest in solid.</p> <p>Do it yourself: Take two empty pots of tin. Connect the pots with a thin wire of approximately twenty meter long. Your friend is speaking through a pot. Try to hear that sound by putting your ear in contact with another pot.</p> <p>Can you hear what your friend is saying? Yes, I can. Here sound is travelling through the wire which is a solid substance.</p> <p><img alt=\"125_image_0.png\" src=\"125_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>Temperature: The more the temperature increases, the more the velocity of sound in the air increases. \n",
            "Chunk 245:\n",
            " For this reason, the velocity of sound is more in summer than that of in winter.</p> <p>Calculate: The velocity of sound is 344ms- at 20℃ temperature and 332ms1 at 0°. How much does the velocity of sound increases for the increase of temperature by 1ºC?</p> <p>Humidity of air: The velocity of sound increases with the increase of humidity. For this reason, the velocity of sound is more in the humid air than that of in dry air.</p> <h2>7.9 Audibility Range And Their Uses:</h2> <p>We know, the sound is not produced without vibration. If an object vibrates at least 20 times per second then the sound produced from that will be heard. Thus, if the frequency is more than 20000 Hz; the sound will not be heard also. So, the range of sound that we can hear is from 20 Hz to 20000 Hz. This frequency range is called range of audibility. If the frequency of any source is less than 20 Hz then it is called infrasonic vibration. If the frequency of any source is more than 20000 Hz then it is called ultrasonic vibration. Though man cannot hear the ultrasonic sound animals like bats, dogs, bees can produce and hear it.</p> <h2>The Application And Use Of Ultrasonic Sound: Determination Of The Depth Of Ocean:</h2> <p>To measure the depth of ocean a machine is used which is called SONAR. The elaboration of SONAR is Sound Navigation And Ranging. \n",

Mixing soap or powder soap with water the clothes are soaked in it then ultrasonic sound is passed through it. This sound removes the dirt from the clothes and they are cleaned.</p> <p>To diagnose disease: As the internal photograph of human body can be captured by X- ray, in the same way the disease can also be identified by capturing picture through ultrasonic sound.

Musical sound and its characteristics: We hear different kind of sounds every day. We hear the sound of vehicles, the sound of market, the sound of rainfall, the sound of musical instruments etc every day. Some of these sounds are sweet and some are harsh. If we judge by our sensation the sweet sounds are musical sounds.</p> <p>The characteristics of musical sound: The three characteristics of musical sounds are1) Loudness or Intensity 2) Pitch and 3) Quality or Timbre.</p> <p>Loudness or Intensity: Loudness or intensity means how loud the sound is. Intensity is the amount of sound energy flowing per second per unit area perpendicular to the direction of propagation of sound. In SI system of unit the unit of intensity of sound is Wm2.</p> <p>Pitch: The characteristic of musical sound by which we can differentiate between a shrill sound and a dull sound of same intensity is called pitch. Pitch depends on the frequency of the source. \n",

            " With the increase of frequency the pitch becomes higher making the note more and more shrill.</p> <h2>Quality Or Timbre:</h2> <p>The characteristic of musical sound by which we can differentiate between two sounds of same intensity and pitch is called quality or timbre.</p> <p>Why the voice of men is deep and the voice of women and children is sharp? There are two membranes in our vocal which are known as vocal chords. The sound is produced due to the vibration of vocal chords and so people can speak.</p> <p>The vocal chords of adult men become thick as they age but the vocal chords of children and women are not thick. For this, the frequency of voice of the adult men is less and the frequency of voice of women and children are more. So the voice of men is deep but the voice of children and women is sharp.</p> <h2>7.11. Noise Pollution</h2> <p>Sound is necessary for mutual communication and exchanging feelings. But the unnecessary sounds and noises are intolerable. When the sound from different sources cross the normal limit of tolerance and causes annoyance and harm to health then it is called noise pollution. The excessive use of mike, the sound of dram, the sound of the explosion of bomb, the sound from industries, the horn of vehicles, loud sound from tape-recorder and television put, the sound from the engine of old car, the sound of aero plane and fighter plane etc. are the main causes of noise pollution.

At present, noise pollution is creating many severe problems. Very often the patients and the examinees become sick due to noise pollution. Reducing noise is the way to remain safe from noise pollution. We can take a few steps in this regard. We have to refrain ourselves from using mike loudly in any ceremony. The use of fireworks and bang sticks must be banned in the festivals. We should avoid using the horn of vehicles unnecessarily and loudly. We can reduce noise pollution by buying low sound producing engine and by establishing industries and airport far from residential area. Open areas should be preserved in the city and more and more trees should be planted to absorb the noise.

Men have been trying to achieve knowledge about the nature of light from an ancient period. Once it was thought that light falls on an object from our eyes, so we see that object. Actually, when light comes to our eyes from an object, only then we can see the object. The major properties of light are: 1.

When light comes from the luminous object to our eyes we see the object. The common objects which we see around us are not luminous; in spite of this we can see them. The reason behind it is the reflection of light. Figure 8.1 shows how we can see a luminous (sun) and a non-luminous (cat) object. Eye sees the luminous object because light enters the eye directly from it.

A clear image of an object placed in front of a mirror is formed due to reflection of light.</p> <p>A mirror is made by giving a reflecting coating on a smooth surface. Generally a mirror is prepared by giving metal coating on one surface of glass. This process of coating with mercury or silver on glass is called silvering. Here, the surface opposite to the surface having metal coating works as the reflecting surface. Besides, surface of calm water, smooth ice etc. works as mirror.</p> <p>Mirrors are mainly of two types. Namely1. Plane mirror 2. Spherical mirror Plane mirror: If the reflecting surface is plane and smooth and regular reflection of light takes place on it, then this surface is called plane mirror. The mirror which we usually use is plane mirror.</p> <h2>Spherical Mirror</h2> <p>If the reflecting surface is smooth and spherical, that means if the reflecting surface is a part of a sphere and regular reflection takes place on it, it is called spherical mirror.</p> <p>Spherical mirrors are shown in figures 8.5 and 8.6. If a part of a hollow glass sphere is cut off and silvering is done on one surface, then a spherical mirror is made. Again, spherical mirrors are of two types. These are: 1. Concave mirror 2. \n",

In this case, concave mirror is made by silvering on the convex surface of the part of the sphere [figure 8.5]. The concave mirror is a converging mirror since the parallel beam of light converges at a point or meets together after reflection from its surface.</p> <p><img alt=\"134_image_0.png\" src=\"134_image_0.png\" /></p> <p><img alt=\"134_image_2.png\" src=\"134_image_2.png\" /></p> <p><img alt=\"134_image_1.png\" src=\"134_image_1.png\" /></p> <p>Convex mirror: If the convex surface of a sphere acts as the reflector, that is if regular reflection of light takes place from the convex surface of the spherical mirror, then it is called a convex mirror. In this case, convex mirror is made by silvering on the concave or inner surface of the part of the sphere [Figure 8.5].

It is not only in the case of mirrors, when you walk by the side of a pond or a river, your image appears in water that time also. This reflection is your image.

If a beam of rays after being reflected from or refracted through any surface meet at a second point or appears to diverge from the second point, then the second point is called the image of the first point. An object is the sum of innumerable points.

This happens due to the reflection of light. Image like this formed in a mirror, through which light ray do not actually meet, is called virtual image. Images in which light rays actually meet together (e.g .- images on a cinema screen) are called real images. The pictures formed in the screen of a digital camera are real images. Real images can be displayed in a screen but the virtual images cannot be displayed in a screen.

These events results from a special property of light called refraction. A special event of refraction is total internal reflection. Mirage is formed in the desert, diamond looks bright and information signals are sent through optical fiber because of total internal reflection of light.

Coming from air medium following the path AB, light ray incidents at point B of the separation surface PQ of two media. If the light ray goes straight it will follow the path BC' but it changes its path and follows BC. This phenomenon of bending of ray of light is called refraction. \n",

Z ABN is called the angle of incidence i and ∠ N'BC is called the angle of refraction r.</p> <p>Since the velocity of light differs from medium to medium, during the change of medium refraction takes place. When ray of light enters from a rarer medium (air) to a denser medium (glass) the refracted ray bends towards the normal i.e. in this case &gt;r again when it enters from a denser medium to a rarer medium it goes away from the normal i.e. in this case r&gt;i.</p> <p>Do it: Put an ink mark on a white paper and place a transparent glass slab on it The point O has raised at point O'.

As a result the angle of refraction becomes greater than the angle of incidence. 1. Suppose AB is the separating surface of glass and air. Glass is denser and air is rarer medium. P is a point in the glass medium. From P a ray of light PQ incidents at point Q of separating surface AB at a small angle. QR is the refracted ray in air [Fig: 9.7(a)].

In this way if the angle of incidence is increased finally for a definite angle of incidence ∠ P¡QN' will be obtained [Fig: 9.7(b)] for which the refracted ray QR will pass along the separating surface AB, i.e. the angle of refraction will be ∠NQR¡=90°. \n",

The value of this critical angle also depends on the nature of the medium and the colour of light.</li> </ol> <h2>Total Internal Reflection:</h2> <p>If the angle of incidence in denser medium is increased further (i &gt; 0,), then the incident ray of light will be totally reflected in the denser medium. In this case no refracted ray can be observed. In this situation the separating surface of the two media behaves like a mirror. This phenomenon is called the total internal reflection.</p> <p>In fig: 9.7(c) the angle of incidence in denser medium ∠P2QN' is greater than the critical angle 0 of the two media. For this reason the light ray P2Q incidents on separating surface AB and reflects along QR2 following the laws of reflection.</p> <h2>Conditions For Total Internal Reflection:</h2> <p>i) The ray of light must incident from a denser medium at the surface of separation of a denser and a rarer medium. ii) The angle of incidence in the denser medium must be greater than the critical angle.</p> <h2>9.4 Mirage</h2> <p>Sometimes thirsty traveler in desert sees the inverted image of a distant tree and thinks there is water. \n",

            " When he comes close to the tree he realizes his mistake that there is no water. This happens due to total internal reflection of light. This very event is called mirage. The sandy surface of desert is rapidly heated by the tremendous heat coming from the sun. So, the layers of air in contact with the sandy surface become hot. As a result the lower layers become hot and lighter but the upper layers are comparatively colder and denser. The ray of light coming from the tree enters continuously into rarer medium from denser medium. As a result the refracted ray continues to go away from the normal. In a certain moment the ray of light incidents on a layer at an angle which is greater than the critical angle and total internal reflection occurs. At that time the upside down image is seen (fig 9.8) and we call it mirage.</p> <p><img alt=\"151_image_0.png\" src=\"151_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>Observation: While walking or travelling in vehicle on a pitch covered road during summer days you may have noticed that the road is wet and silvery.

A set of optical fiber is called optical tube.</p> <h2>Uses Of Optical Fiber In The Field Of Health And Telecommunication:</h2> <p>An optical tube is passed through the mouth to stomach in order to examine the inner wall of the stomach of any patient. A set of optical fiber of this optical tube is sent to lighten the stomach and the other set helps to see the lightened portion of stomach from the outside. This process is known as endoscopy. In this way by sending optical tube the block inside the artery, vein and function of valves of heart can be observed. Optical fiber is used for sending or receiving electrical signals from one place to another. Before sending, the electrical signal has to be converted into optical signal.</p> <p>Near about 2000 telephone signals can be transmitted at a time through a single optical fiber. Almost no change takes place to the intensity of the signals for this kind of transmission. \n",

Lenses are of two types: i) Convex lens or converging lens ii) Concave lens or diverging lens Convex lens: The lens whose mid portion is thick but the edges are thin is called convex lens.

Due to this black layer light is not reflected internally Ciliary muscle within the eye.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Figure: 9.20 5. Iris: Just behind the cornea, there is an opaque diaphragm. It is called Iris. The colour of the Iris may vary from person to person.</p> <p>Usually the colour of Iris is black, light azure or deep brown. Iris regulates the amount of light falling on the eye lens.</p> <p>Pupil: The hole at the centre of the Iris is called Pupil. Through this pupil, light 6. </p> <p>enters the eyes.</p> <p>Eye lens: It is the most important part of the eye. It is situated just behind the pupil.</p> <p>7.</p> <p>It is made of transparent organic substances. Its radius of curvature of the back side is greater than that of the front side. This lens is hooked in the eye ball by ciliary muscles and suspensor ligaments. \n",
            "Chunk 304:\n",
            " Due to the contractions and suspension of these muscles and ligaments, the curvature of the lens changes. It ultimately changes the focal length. To see different objects of near and distance, we need to adjust our focal length.</p> <p>Retina: Just behind the eye lens, there is a layer of semi-transparent light sensitive 8.</p> <p>membrane in the innermost side of the eye ball. It is called the retina. It is made of some nerve-fibers called rods and cones. These nerve-fibers are connected to the eye-nerves. When light falls on the retina, it creates a kind of excitement in nervefibers. Hence, a sensation of vision is created in the brain.</p> <p>Aqueous humour and Vitreous humour: The saline watery fluid that fills up the space between the eye lens and cornea is called aqueous humour. On the other hand, the jelly like substance that fills the gap between retina and eye lens is called vitreous humour. Accommodation of eye: If an object is placed before a convex lens, it forms a real image at the back of the lens. If a screen is placed at the back of the lens an inverted image of the object is found on the screen.</p> <p>Experiment proves that in a certain place of the screen the image is most clear. For any reason, if the object is moved forward to or backward from the lens, the screen is to be moved forward or backward as well to get a clear image. \n",

            " Now if we want to get a clear image of the object on the screen at its previous position, we have to use lenses of different focal lengths.</p> <p>Things happen in a similar way in case of eyes. The cornea, aqueous humour, eye lens and vitreous humour together work as a convergent lens system. If any object is placed before our eyes and if the image of that object is reflected on our retina, then there will be a sensation of vision in the brain. As a result, we see the object. We see objects of different distances through our eyes. The specialty of the eye lens is that it changes its shape according to the necessity and thus it changes its focal length. Due to the change of the focal length, image of objects at any position is always formed at the same distance from the lens. Therefore, clear images are formed on the retina. The capacity of eyes to change their focal length to see objects of any distance is called the accommodation power of eyes. And the process is called accommodation of eye.</p> <p>Least distance of distinct vision: From our daily experience, we see that the closer the object is to the eyes the clearer it is to see. But, there is a point after which it cannot be seen clearly. The nearest point at which eyes can see without any difficulty is called the distance of distinct vision. For any normal eye, this distance is nearly 25cm. So, the near point of a normal eye is 25 cm away from the eye. \n",
            "Chunk 306:\n",
            " It is difficult for our eyes to see any object clearly that stays closer to this distance.</p> <p>Again, the distance which is maximum from the eye to see an object is called the farthest distance of distinct vision. It is also called the far point of the eye. The far point of any normal eye is at infinity. This means that a normal eye can see up to a huge distance.</p> <p>Persistence of vision: If any object is placed before our eyes an image of the object is formed in our retina. As a result of it, we see the object. For any reason, if the object is removed from our eyes, a sensation of that object stays in our brain for about 0.1 second.</p> <p>This period is called the persistence of vision.</p> <h2>Advantage Of Having Two Eyes:</h2> <p>If we see an object by our two eyes we can only see a single object. Though each eye forms individual images on their own retinas but the brain combines the two images to make a single one. We can measure the distance accurately for having two eyes. So, it is very difficult to thread a needle keeping one eye closed. Apart from that, due to the relative position of our eyes with respect to the object we see the right portion of the object better with our right eye and the left portion better with our left eye. \n",

It is necessary to change the focal length of eye lens to see the distant as well as near objects.</p> <p>Figure: 9.21</p> <p><img alt=\"159_image_0.png\" src=\"159_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>In figure 9.21 the eye lens is shown. In front of the eye i.e. in front of the lens PQ is an object. A ray of light PR coming from P parallel to the principal axis incidents at R and is refracted through the principal focus F along the path RFP1. Another ray PO coming from P passes through the optical centre O and is refracted along the path OP1. The refracted rays RP1 and OP1 meet at point P1. From point P1 a perpendicular P1Q1 is drawn on the principal axis. So, P1Q1 is the real and inverted image of PQ. Where the image is formed is known as retina. It consists of some light sensitive cells or nerve-fibers called rods and cones. \n",
            "Chunk 308:\n",
            " When image or light falls on retina a kind of stimulation is created in the nerve-fibers and as a result a sensation of vision is created in the brain and we can see the object.</p> <p>It is mentionable that the inverted image of an object is formed on retina. This sensation is transmitted to the brain by the eye nerves. The brain then and there inverts the inverted image formed in the retina and we can see the object in its right shape and size.</p> <h2>9.11 Defects Of Vision And Its Remedy</h2> <p>The range of vision of a normal eye is 25 cm to infinite distance. This means that normal eye can see any object at a distance between 25 cm to infinity. An eye which is unable to see any object distinctly within this distance that eye is a defective eye. Usually an eye has two kinds of defects. These are: 1. Short sight or Myopia 2. Long sight or Hypermetropia 1. Short sight or Myopia: If anybody has this problem, he or she cannot see any distant object distinctly but can see anything of near distance distinctly. Sometimes the distance of near point for such an eye is less than 25 cm. Therefore, if the near point of the eye is less than 25cm then that is also considered as short sight. Cause: This defect may be caused if the radius of the eye ball increases or if the focal length decreases for any reason and thereby increases the power of convergence of the eye lens. \n",

            " [Figure 9.22 (a) ]</p> <p><img alt=\"160_image_0.png\" src=\"160_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>Effects of such problem: In this case, rays of light coming from any object placed at large distance, after refraction through the eye lens converge to a point I in front of the retina (Fig. 9.22 a). As a result, objects are not seen distinctly. For this kind of eye, the far point is not situated at infinity. Rather, it is a certain finite point F. For this reason, such type of eye cannot see object distinctly placed beyond F (Fig 9.22(b) ] Remedy: It has been said earlier that such type of defect arises due to the increase in the power of convergence of the eye lens. To remedy this defect, we need to decrease the power of convergence of the eye lens. For doing this, concave lens is used as aid lens or as spectacles.</p> <p>Besides, only a concave lens can create a virtual, erect and diminished image at a position nearer than that of the object. Therefore, to rectify short sight, a concave lens or spectacles should be used as aid lens in front of the eye. They should have such focal length or power so that due to refraction through the image of an object placed at infinity the image is formed at the far point of the defective eye [ fig 9.22 c]. We know that when the object is at infinity its virtual image is formed at the principal focus of the concave lens. \n",

Effect of such problem: In such a case, rays coming from the object placed at the near point of a normal eye, after refraction through the eye lens converge to a point I behind the retina [Fig. 9.23 (a)]. As a result, the image becomes blurred. The near point N of such an eye shifts away to O, which is more than 25 cm (the distance of the near point for a normal eye). Therefore, such a defective eye cannot see any objects distinctly, which is placed nearer to O [Fig 9.23 (b)].</li> </ol> <p><img alt=\"160_image_1.png\" src=\"160_image_1.png\" /></p> <p>Remedy: It is already said that such defect of eye arises due to the decrease in the power of convergence of the eye lens. Therefore, to rectify the defect, the power of convergence of the eye lens should be increased. For this, convex lens of suitable focal length i.e. of suitable power should be used as aid lens or spectacles. We also know that only a convex lens can provide a virtual and erect image at a distance greater than that of the object. \n",

            " For this reason, a convex lens of suitable focal length or power is used in this case as aid lens or spectacles in front of the eye. The focal length of this lens should be such so that due to the refraction the virtual image of an object placed at normal near point N, is formed at the near point O of the defective eye. [Fig 9.23 (c)]</p> <h2>9.12 Perceptions Of Coloured Object:</h2> <p>When we see an object, then the light from the object falls on our eyes. The light being refracted by the lens of eye forms an image of the object on retina. There are numerous nerves in retina which send this perception to brain. We can see the object after the perfect analysis of the signals in the brain. The nerves that have reached the brain from retinas are called rods and cones. Among them the cones cells are colour sensitive. There are three types of cone cells - blue colour sensitive, red colour sensitive and green colour sensitive cone cells. It does not matter whether the colour is compound or complex, the eye perceives the colour of an object in terms of these three colours. The cone cells of retina send the accumulated information to brain. Brain separates all these colours through a particular process. Thus we can perceive the colour of coloured object.</p> <h2>9.13 Uses Of Refraction In Our Daily Life:</h2> <p>There is a convex lens in our eyes. When we seen an object, the light from the object, being refracted by the lens of the eye, forms an image on retina. \n",
            "Chunk 312:\n",
            " We can see the object when a real and inverted image of that object is formed on retina. So, refraction of light helps us to see an object. There are many people who have defects in their eyes. Among them some cannot see the distant object, some cannot see near object. For the remedy of the defects we use spectacles made by lens of particular power. The incoming light refracted through the lens falls on our eyes and helps to see the object properly. Therefore, refraction plays an important role to see an object.</p> <p>By using the property of refraction of light we can take photograph with camera, we can see very small object magnifying it by microscope and see the distant object by telescope.</p> <p>The optical fiber that we use in the field of health and telecommunication is also the contribution of refraction of light.</p> <p>There are fish aquariums in many of our houses. If we keep some colour fish in the aquarium we can enjoy their interesting movement. The light from the fish coming through water at first falls on the glass of the aquarium. After the refraction of light through the glass, the sight reaches our eyes. Therefore it is also a contribution of refraction of light.</p> <h2>Investigation: 9.1</h2> <p>Image formation by a convex lens and its demonstration.</p> <p>Objective: Use of convex lens and production of real image in the lab.

In our daily life we observe that many objects around us behave like the comb of Sourov.</p> <p>Do it yourself: Rub your dry hair with your plastic scale for a while and hold it near some pieces of paper.</p> <p>We see that an object attracts another object in a special condition or becomes charged that is electricity produced in the object. Their charge remains static in the place of its production. So it is called static electricity. Now let us see what we mean by being charged.</p> <p>We know that each matter is consisted of small particles. The atom of every matter consists of electrons and which revolves around the nucleus. In the nucleus there are two type of particles-proton and neutron. The fundamental and special property of primary particles (electron and proton) of which the matter consist of is electrical property, which is determined by charge. The charges of electrons are negative and the charges of protons are considered to be positive. Neutron is electrically neutral that is it has no charge. The amount of charge in a proton is equal to the charge of an electron. Naturally an atom has an equal number of protons and electrons. As a result in the atom whole atom there is no electrical property to be detected. \n",

But if their number is not equal in any atom, then the atom will be charged. If the number of electron decreases, the number of proton increases. This situation is said to be charged positively. Again, if these scattered electrons are joined with any atom, the number of its electron increases, as a result it is charged negatively. The shortage or excess of electrons in any atom is considered to be charged. The substances through which electricity or electric charge can pass easily are called conductors, e.g. metal, soil, human body etc. Generally the metals are good conductors.</p> <p>Copper, silver, aluminium etc are good conductors.

Again when a rod of ebonite or polythene is rubbed with flannel, polythene rod gets charged negatively and the flannel becomes positively charged. Because polythene has more affinity for electrons than that of flannel and so when they are rubbed together free electrons of flannel moves to ebonite or polythene and gets charged negatively [Fig 10.3].</p> <h2>10.3 Electric Induction</h2> <p>We know that when two bodies are rubbed together electric charge is produced. \n",

If the charge is a free one, gaining this force instead of remaining stationary it would move in a definite path. Electric line of force is the path of a free positive charge that moves in an electric field. There is no real existence of lines of force. These lines are imaginary. The electric lines of force are used to for measuring the electric intensity and explaining its direction at a point in an electric field. The lines of force of an electric field are such that, the tangent drawn at a point to a line of force indicates the direction of electric intensity at that point. The number of lines of force passing through unit area perpendicular to the lines of force at a point in the electric field is proportional to magnitude of the electric intensity at that point.

            " Potential determines the direction of motion of a charge in an electric field and also determines the direction in which the charge will flow when two charged conductors are connected by a conductor wire. If the charge creating field is positive, some work is done against the force of repulsion if another positive charge is brought near it. Therefore, the more positive charge is brought from a point at infinity nearer to the body, the more work will have to be done. So, within the electric field of a positively charged body, the more a point is brought nearer to the body, the more will be the quantity of potential. If any electric field created by a positively charged body and a free positive charge is placed and allowed to move freely, it would go away from the body. Therefore, we can say that positive charge moves from higher potential to lower potential. On the other hand, negative charge moves towards positively charged body. Thus, negative charge moves from lower potential to higher potential. If the body creating the electric field is charged negatively, then some work will be done due to attraction of a unit positive charge bringing towards it. A positive charge itself does work while coming from infinity towards a negatively charged body, which creates an electric field. As a result the charge loses energy and the potential at a point in the electric field is considered as negative.</p> <p>Measurement of potential: The work done to bring a unit positive charge from infinity to a point in an electric field is called the potential of that point. \n",

            " So, potential is an electric condition of a charged conductor that determines whether it takes or gives up charge when connected to another charged conductor by a connecting wire.</p> <h2>Similarity Between Potential And Temperature And Free Surface Of Liquid:</h2> <p>The role which is played by temperature and the height of free surface of liquid in heat and hydrostatics respectively, potential plays the same role in electrostatics. We know, if we connect two bodies thermally, there may be exchange of heat between them. The flow of heat does not depend on the mass of i.e. inherent heat within it, but on the temperature. If we connect a highly heated body with another body which is much heavier but of low in temperature, then heat will flow from the small body to the large body, though the amount of heat is much greater in the larger body than the smaller one.</p> <p>Two tubes A and B are placed at same horizontal level. They are connected by a tube with a stop cock S (Fig: 10.13). Closing the stop cock water is poured in to A and B tubes in such a way so the height of water column is same in two tubes. As the diameter of B is much greater than that of A, to raise the water level at same height much more water is requires for tube B. \n",
            "Chunk 337:\n",
            " Now if the stop</p> <p>Figure: 10.13</p> <p><img alt=\"172_image_0.png\" src=\"172_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>cock is opened there would be no change in water height i.e. there is no flow of water.</p> <p>Though the amount of water is different in two tubes, but as there is height is same, so there is no flow of water. Now if closing the stop cock a little amount water is poured into A tube, the amount of water in it will still be less than that of B, but the height of water level will increase slightly. After if the stop cock is opened, then water will flow from A to and the height of the water column will w same in both A and B. It is thus understood that flow of water does not depend on the amount of water rather the height. Suppose two conductors are positively charged. The amount of charge in first conductor is greater than that of second conductor but the potential of the first one is less than that of the second. Now if, two conductors are connected electricity then positively charge will flow from second conductor to first conductor. Though the amount of charge is greater in first conductor yet it will take charge because its potential is low. \n",
            "Chunk 338:\n",
            " As a result of flow of charges when the potential of the two conductor become equal then the flow will stop.</p> <p>Therefore it can be said, the role of temperature in heat, role of free surface of liquid in hydrostatic and the role of potential in electrostatic are same.</p> <h2>Electric Potential Of Earth:</h2> <p>Earth is an electric conductor. When a charged body is connected to the earth, it becomes electrically neutral. When a positively charged body is grounded electrons coming from the earth neutralize the body. When a negatively charged body is grounded electrons from the body flow to the earth and the body becomes neutral. The earth is so big that if charge is added or taken away from it its potential does not change at all.</p> <p>Likewise if water is taken away from sea or poured in the water level does not change.</p> <p>The earth is always taking charge from different bodies and simultaneously it supplies charge to other bodies. Hence earth is considered charge less. To determine the height of a place the height of the sea level is taken as zero, similarly to determine the potential of a body, the potential of earth is taken as zero.</p> <h2>Zero, Positive And Negative Potential:</h2> <p>The potential of an uncharged conductor is taken as zero. When a charged conductor is connected to the earth its potential becomes zero. Because, in the connected state , both the conductor and the earth is considered as a single conductor. \n",
            "Chunk 339:\n",

The work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to point A is VA and to point B is VB Therefore the work done in bringing a unit positive charge from point B to point A is VA -VB  VA VB i.e. the potential difference between these two - B points.</p> <p>Figure: 10.14 The work done in transferring a unit positive charge from one point to another point in an electric field is called potential difference between two points.</p> <h2>10.8 Electric Capacitor:</h2> <p>The capability of storing energy as electric charge is called capacitor. \n",

A capacitor is made by placing an insulating material such as air, glass, plastic etc. Therefore, the mechanical process of storing energy as electric charges by placing an insulating medium in between two nearby conductors is called capacitor.</p> <p><img alt=\"173_image_0.png\" src=\"173_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>A simple capacitor is made by placing two insulating metal plates parallel to each other.</p> <p>When a battery is connected to its two plates (Fig:10.15) then electrons may flow to a plate from its negative rod and is charged negatively. Electrons flow to the positive rod of battery from the other plate of the capacitor. As a result that plate is charged positively. The amount of charge deposited in the plates depends on the voltage of the battery.</p> <p>Capacitors are used in radio, television, record player and the circuits of other electronic devices widely.</p> <p>10.9 Uses and Dangers of Static Electricity: 1. Electrostatic Painting Spray: Nowadays painting spray is used to colour car, cycle, cupboard or other things with help of static electricity. Spray gun is made in such a way that it produces very small charged particles of colour. The sharp edge of the painting spray gun is connected to a terminal of the static electrical generator. \n",
            "Chunk 341:\n",
            " The other terminal of the generator is connected to the metal plate to be coloured which must Figure: 10.16</p> <p><img alt=\"174_image_0.png\" src=\"174_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>be connected with earth. In case of colouring a car the charged small particle emitted from the spray gun attracts the outer frame of the car. As a result a uniform layer of colour is formed on the outer surface of the car. Moreover these small particles move along the electric lines of force and reach the narrower places of its surface and colour it. 2. Ink Jet Printer: This is the most ordinary printer which remains connected to the computer. An ink-gun with its narrow mouth projects very small particles of ink. These small particles are positively charged. These ink particles move through the space between two plates. These positively charged ink particles are repelled by the positive plate and attracted by the negative plate. A computer controls the voltage of the plates in such a way that the plates are sometimes positively charged and sometimes negatively charged. And the ink particles fall on moving paper scattered in different places to give the necessary shape of letters and pictures. For colour print four kinds of colour are used.</p> <ol> <li>Photocopier: Nowadays photocopier or photocopy machine is very essential and thus it has become very popular machine. Not only the educational institutions and other offices but also general people use this machine to photocopy any kind of necessary papers and documents. Static energy is also used in this machine. \n",
            "Chunk 342:\n",
            " There is a rotating dram inside the dark part of the photocopier. Positive charge is sprayed over the dram. A bright light lights up the page to be photocopied. The white part of the page reflects light but the dark or printed part does not reflect light. The reflected light centers on the dram. Charges releases from the part of the dram where the reflected light from white paper falls. Only the dark part of the dram is charged positively. Negatively charged ink of carbon powder (toner) is sprayed over the dram. Negatively charged ink particles get stick to the positively charged part of the dram. A piece of white paper is positively charged and is kept pressed with the dram. This paper picks up the pattern of carbon powder on its surface from the dram. Positively charged paper attracts the negatively charged toner. Then the paper is passed through the heated roller. As a result the ink of the toner gets melted and mixed with the paper and makes a permanent copy.</li> </ol> <p><img alt=\"174_image_1.png\" src=\"174_image_1.png\" /></p> <h2>Danger Of Static Electricity:</h2> <p>Sometimes the presence of static electricity is harmful and may cause danger. Loading of fuel in aero plane: When aero plane flies in the air it may electrify due to the friction with air. If the charge increases continuously the potential difference between the aero plane and the earth increases simultaneously. \n",
            "Chunk 343:\n",
            " Due to this high potential difference when the fuel is loaded there is possibility of releasing some charge to the ground which may create spark. This spark may lead to a huge explosion. This is why the wheels of aero plane are made of conductor rubber so that the stored charges in the aero plane can be released safely to the ground when it lands.</p> <p>The solution of the problem is that a conductor is to be connected to the aero plane and to the ground as soon as it lands and just before the loading is started. Loading of Fuel into Tanker: Sparking or explosion may occur when a truck or tanker etc carries fuel from one place to another. To prevent this type of danger the tanker should be connected to the ground by a conductor.</p> <p>Television and Monitors of Computer: During the operating period television and monitor of computer, electrostatic charges are produced. These charges attract the uncharged dust particles thus they become dirty soon.</p> <p>Change of clothes: Sometimes our wearing clothes may be charged due to the friction with us. When we change our clothes, there is a possibility of getting light shock as the charges pass to the ground through our body. Operation Theater: Necessary measures have to be taken to keep the surgeons, concerned people and treatment equipments of the operation theater in a hospital free from electric charges as they attract dirt and germs. This is why they have to wear conductor shoes of rubber and use rubber gloves. So that electron can pass through them to the ground. Hanging metal chain with petrol transporting truck: A metal chain has to be hung touching the road with the trucks that carries petrol, diesel or other liquid fuels. \n",
            "Chunk 344:\n",
            " When a truck moves along the road, the petrol in the tank dashes against the inner surface of the tank and oscillates to and fro. As a result of this, friction charge is stored in petrol. If any spark takes place from the edge of the tank it may cause serious accident and may set fire. So the charges in petrol are not safe. Therefore a chain is connected at the back of the tank so that the charge can pass through it to the ground easily as metal is a good conductor.</p> <p>No direct connection between metal pillar and electric line: The metal pillars on the road have no direct connection with electric lines pulled over the pillars. As metals are good conductors, the electricity of the wire may pass through the pillar to the ground if the pillar has connection with wires. If anyone touches the pillar he could immediately be electrified causing serious accident. So the wires are connected to the pillars by a porcelain cup.</p> <p>Thunder bolt and lightning conductors: We know that there is water vapor in atmosphere.</p> <p>This water vapor being condensed on the charged ions on the atmosphere and form water droplets and become charged with electricity. When these water droplets gather together cloud is formed. Cloud can be charged either positively or negatively. When two oppositely charged clouds come close to each other then electrical discharge takes place between them and makes huge spark. This is called lightning or electric flash.</p> <p>During electric flash the air around the cloud expands suddenly by getting heated. Due to sudden expansion the pressure of the air lowers much. Then neighboring air at higher pressure contracts the expanded air. \n",
            "Chunk 345:\n",
            " Due to this sudden expansion and contraction of air, violent sound is produced. This is known as roaring of thunder. If there is too much charge on a cloud then it includes opposite charge on the surface of the earth and electric discharge takes place. This is known as thunder bolt.</p> <p>Lightning conductor or lightning arrester: In order to protect buildings from the ravage of lightning the lightning conductor is used. The metallic rod R (Fig 10.18) with several sharp points at the top is fixed in such a way that its upper end extends several feet above the roof of the building and lowers end runs down along the outer surface of the building and buried well inside the moist earth.</p> <p>When a charged cloud passes above the building then the charge of opposite kind is induced in the conductor rod R. The accumulation of charge is at maximum at the pointed ends of lightning conductor and pointed ends discharges their charge to the air particles around it. The air particles around the sharp points are charged by conduction and are attracted by the opposite charges of cloud and moves towards the cloud is Fig: 10.18 neutralized. As a result the probability of thunder bolt decreases.</p> <p>Electricity always passes following the shortest path through a conductor. The charge produced in the clouds tends to reach the earth through the high standing objects. During storm and rain it is rather good to wet in rain than to stand under an umbrella, any tree, near any conductor, iron bridge or fence of sharp iron wire. \n",

This flow of electron continues until the potential difference between the two bodies becomes zero. If by any process the potential difference between the two objects is maintained, then this flow of electron goes on continuously. This continuous flow of electrons is electric current.</p> <p>The amount of charge that flows in unit time through any cross section of a conductor is called electric current. If through any cross section of a conductor, the quantity of charge Q flows in time t, then the electric current will be I = 2 Unit: The unit of electric current is ampere. If an amount of charge 1 C flows in 1 second through any cross section of a conductor, then the quantity of electric current produced is called 1 A.

Such type of charges is called electrostatic charge. However, if we can provide a conducting path, the charges will flow instead of being bound on the conductor. When it happens, we say an electric current is produced.</p> <p>How electric current is produced from moving charges is described in terms of the circuit as shown in figure 11.1. At the start of the experiment, two plug keys K1 and K2 are taken out and the two metal plates A and B are uncharged by touching with hand. Now, if the plug K1 is closed, the high voltage source will be connected to the two metal plates. Next, switch on the high voltage source to charge up the two metal plates positively and negatively by an equal amount. Now, key K1 is removed and key K2 is pluged in to provide a continuous conducting path linking the positively and negatively charged metal plates to the galvanometer. Here, the galvanometer is a device that can detect the existence of flow of current. It would be observed that the pointer in the galvanometer is seen to deflect momentarily to one side and then quickly return to its initial position.</p> <p>The galvanometer's deflection shows that an electric current is produced. How this electric current is produced? \n",
            "Chunk 354:\n",
            " The current is caused by the flow of electrons from the negatively charged plate B through the galvanometer and then to positively charged plate A. The positive charges of plate A are neutralized by the incoming negatively charged electrons. As a result, the transient current which is detected by the galvanometer is produced due to the discharge of the two metal plates.</p> <h2>11.2 Direction Of Electric Current And Direction Of Electron Flow</h2> <p>When current electricity was invented first, it was assumed that the electricity was produced due to the flow of positive charges. This positive charge flows from higher potential to lower potential. So, the direction of conventional current is taken to be from higher potential to lower potential or from positive plate to negative plate of an electric cell. But we know that actually electric current is the flow of negative charges or of electrons, so the actual direction of electric current is from lower potential to higher potential. That is from negative plate to positive plate of an electric cell. Therefore, the actual direction of electric current is opposite to that of conventional current. The arrow demonstrated in the diagram is indicating the direction of conventional current.</p> <p><img alt=\"181_image_0.png\" src=\"181_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>Figure: 11.2</p> <h2>11.3 Electric Symbols</h2> <p>The complete path through which electric current can flow is called electric circuit.

The electrical energy produced is transmitted to the different substations situated at different places by the electricity transmission system. Then from different substations this electrical energy is distributed to the consumers by electricity distribution system again.</p> <p>In the power station the electrical energy is generated at low voltage. \n",
            "Chunk 382:\n",
            " Then this low voltage is transformed into high voltage by the step-up transformer. The conducting wires which are used for electricity transmission have a definite amount of resistance. As a result, to overcome this resistance, part of the electrical energy is converted to heat. That is, a loss or decay of energy occurs. This loss of energy is termed as system loss. Due to the transmission of electricity at high voltage, the loss that occurs due to the power grid or of conductor is decreased to a great extent. For a definite amount of electrical energy, the value of the electric current becomes lower due to high voltage transmission. As an example- if the transmission line voltage is increased by ten times, then the electric current becomes one tenth. As a result, the i2R loss of the power grid becomes one hundredth. Therefore, by increasing the transmission line voltage we can lower the system loss.</p> <h2>Load Shedding</h2> <p>Each of the power stations generates a definite amount of electric power. The electricity generated by all the power stations is added in the national power grid. According to the demand of different locality power sub-stations collect electricity from the national grid.</p> <p>Then the power sub-station delivers or distributes the electricity to the consumer level.</p> <p>When in a particular area, the demand of electricity exceeds the supply or generation; the power sub-station can no longer fulfill the demand of electricity. Then the sub-station authority is forced to switch off or to disconnect the power distribution for a while in some parts of the distribution network. This is called load shedding. \n",
            "Chunk 383:\n",
            " When the substation gets the supply according to its demand, then it distributes electricity in that region again. If the load shedding takes place for a couple of hours continuously, authority load sheds circularly in different area to make load shedding tolerable at the consumer level.</p> <h2>11.14 Safe And Effective Use Of Electricity Dangers Of Electricity</h2> <p>Electricity plays a very important role in our daily lives. Though electricity is very useful to us, it can also be very dangerous in the careless uses. Any type of faults in electrical appliances or circuits can cause fires and electric shocks. Due to the passage of electricity through the body there is a risk of death of people. Uses of electricity can be dangerous due to three reasons described below.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Damaged insulation 2. Overheating of the cables 3. Damped conditions 1.   Damaged insulation: The electrical appliances work when these are connected to the voltage source by two conducting wires to complete the circuit. These two wires are called live and neutral wire. These conducting wires are usually insulated with rubber. Then they are wound together to form a cable and enclosed by PVC or rubber. These insulating materials become worn with time and use. For example- the electrical cables of the electric iron which we use in home get bent and twisted because of the way they are used. This might cause the electrical insulation to crack and break. As a result, the conducting wires inside is exposed. If by any means a person comes into contact with the exposed live wire, it may cause severe electric shock to the user. \n",
            "Chunk 384:\n",
            " If the live and neural wires come into mutual contact due to the damaged insulation, a short circuit will happen and may cause a fire.</p> </li> <li> <p>Overheating of the cables: Overheating of cables occur when unusually large current flows through the electric cables or conducting wires. For example- an unusual large current flows, when an electric fan motor overheats and melts, as a result the live and neutral wire is fused together. Besides this, we make connection of too many electrical devices in a wall socket by using a multi-plug. Due to this, the conducting wire connected to the socket draws more current from the main line than the current which the conducting wire can draw safely. As a result, the cable wire is overheated, insulation is melted and causes fire.</p> </li> <li> <p>Damped conditions: Many electrical accidents may occur in damped conditions. We know, electricity can pass through water. The parts of an electric appliance which are not insulated must be kept dry. Otherwise, there is a risk of short circuits and electric shocks. As an example, leaving a hair dryer on a wet sink is very dangerous. The person using the sink could be electrocuted if the wires were exposed or the insulation had damaged. Besides this, switching on or off of an electric switch by wet hand is risky.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Figure: 11.14</p> <h2>Safe Use Of Electricity</h2> <p>In the previous section you were informed about the dangers of electricity. \n",

Circuit breaker 2. </p> <p>Fuses 3. Correct connection of switch Earth wire 4.</p> <h2>1. Circuit Breaker</h2> <p>Circuit breakers are used as safety devices. Generally this is placed near the front door of a house. Circuit breaker switches off the electrical supply in a circuit when there is an overflow of current. Circuit breaker disconnects the electrical supply in a definite part of the house. Without circuit breaker in a circuit, this excessive current can cause damage of home appliances or even start a fire.</p> <ol> <li>Fuses: A fuse is a safety device. A fuse is included in an electrical circuit to prevent excessive current flow. The fuse is always connected to the live wire of electrical cables. A short thin piece of wire is used as a fuse. The fuse becomes hot and melts when the electric current flowing through it is greater than a definite value. As a result, the circuit is disconnected and the electrical appliances will be safe. The fuse is marked with definite amount of current on its body. Fuses will be such that it can bring slightly higher current than the maximum current an electrical device or appliance can tolerate safely. If the fuse burns, the appliance will not be electrified any more. \n",
            "Chunk 386:\n",
            " Before changing fuse, you have to switch off the mains of electricity supply.</li> </ol> <p>3.</p> <p>Correct connection of switch: A switch breaks or completes an electrical circuit.</p> <p>During switch connection in a circuit, an important precaution is that the switch must be fitted onto the live wire. For this, switching off will disconnect the high voltage source from the appliance instantly [Figure 11.15]. If the switch is fitted onto the neutral wire wrongly, the electric appliance will be 'live' even if the switch is 'off' [Figure 11.16] and increase the risk of electric shock.</p> <p><img alt=\"198_image_0.png\" src=\"198_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>Figure 11.15 and 11.16 Earth wire: All electrical appliances or devices need at least two wires to form a 4.</p> <p>complete circuit.

            " If the live wire is not properly connected and it touches the metal casing of the appliance- the user may be electrocuted from an electric shock. Earthing of the casing prevents this from happening. In this case, the large current will flow from the live wire to the earth through the metal casing. As a result, the fuse will blow out and cut off the electric supply to the appliance. It is strongly recommended to provide an earthing to the refrigerator in houses for safe use of it. Figure 11.17 demonstrates how a washing machine without earthing may be risky. How earth wire works as a safety precaution is demonstrated in figure 11.18.</p> <p><img alt=\"198_image_1.png\" src=\"198_image_1.png\" /></p> <p>Figure 11.17 and 11.18</p> <p><img alt=\"199_image_0.png\" src=\"199_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>Figure: 11.18 In addition, three-pin plugs are used in many portable devices.

This magnet is used to remove the dust of iron from the eye. Besides, this magnet is also used as earpiece of telephone and lock of magnetic door.</p> <h2>12.5. Electromagnetic Induction</h2> <p>Many scientists tried to invent electric current from the magnetic field when Oerested invented electromagnetic effect. Among the scientists who worked on this subject, Michael Faraday of England, Joseph Henry of America and H.F.E. Lenz of Russia achieved success individually. But at first Michael Faraday published the result of his experiments in 1831.He shows that a variable magnetic field can produce electromotive force which creats electric current through a closed circuit. \n",
            "Chunk 396:\n",
            " The phenomena to produce electric current in a closed circuit by variable magnetic field is called electromagnetic induction. Faraday made two experiments to invent electromagnetic induction. You can also do the experiments. Experiment-1: An insulated wire is wound over a card board cylinder in the form of a coil. Connect a galvanometer with two sides of this coil to understand the presence of electric current. You have to open the non conducting cover during the time of connection. Now insert the south pole of a magnet bar inside the coil.</p> <p>What's happening? Deflection of the galvanometer is taking place. It means the current is flowing through the Figure: 12.4</p> <p><img alt=\"204_image_1.png\" src=\"204_image_1.png\" /></p> <p>coil. Now remove the magnet. What's happening? The deflection of galvanometer will be the opposite of that time when magnet was entered to the coil. If the magnet is kept stationary now, the galvanometer will show the deflections when the coil is moved towards or away from the magnet. If the coil is moved away from the magnet, we can see the deflection at the opposite side. Experiment-2: For this experiment two closed coil made of insulated copper wire to be taken. A galvanometer is to be connected with the first coil. In the second coil, a battery, a rheostat and a tapping key are to be connected [12.5a]. \n",
            "Chunk 397:\n",
            " The coil which is connected to the sources of emf is called the primary coil and which is connected to the galvanometer is called secondary coil. When the current is switched on in the primary coil, the deflection of galvanometer will be seen for a moment in the secondary coil [12.5b].</p> <p>Again the deflection of galvanometer will be seen at the time of disconnecting the electric current but the deflection will be opposite to the direction of former.</p> <p>If the current is continuously varied in the primary coil, the galvanometer will show the deflections. In this case, the direction in which the galvanometer will deflect during rise of current is opposite to that during fall of current. Keeping the current fixed in the primary coil a variation of the distance between the two coils will produce a momentary deflection of the galvanometer. The direction of deflection due to increase of distance is opposite to that due to reduction in distance between the coils.</p> <p><img alt=\"205_image_1.png\" src=\"205_image_1.png\" /></p> <p>Figure: 12.5 a 12.6. \n",

So if we move a magnet towards or away from the the coil or if we move a coil towards or away from a magnet, the electric current will be produced there. This is called electromagnetic induction. If we move a coil towards or away from electric circuit or electric wire, the electric current will be produced there also. This is also called electromagnetic induction. So we can say that the process of creating electric current through the change of the distance of the circuit which can create voltage temporarily to another closed circuit is called electromagnetic induction.</p> <p>This voltage is known as induced voltage and the current is known as induced current. If there have no relative motion between magnet and coil, the deflection will not be seen.</p> <p>The more will be the relative motion, the more will be the deflection. So it is said that how long the relative motion will last between magnet and coil, induced current will be durable for that period. If the pole of magnet is altered, the side of induced current will be altered. \n",

Effect Of Magnet On Current Carrying Wire</h2> <p>We know that current carrying wire produced a magnetic field of its own. There happens action and reaction between magnetic field exsisting inside the opposite pole of a powerful magnet and the magnetic field of current carrying wire.</p> <p>Your teacher can show you the action and reaction. You can do it yourself or with the help of your teacher. Put an electric wire between the two poles of a powerful Figure: 12.6 magnet like the picture. Let the electricity flow through this wire.

From where does this come?</p> <p>If you look at the picture 12.7(a), you will see the lines of force between the poles of the magnet. The magnetic field created by electric current has also been shown. The lines of force created from the combination of two fields has also been shown in the picture 12.7(b). The lines of force are more in the down than that of the up of the wire. The reason is that both the fields are working towards the same direction. \n",

So, the wire will go to the upward in A and downward in B. For this the wire moves in clockwise. At the vertical position of the wire like figure 12.8(b) no force will act on it. For this it will be stopped. To keep the coil rotating, we will use a device named commutator. \n",

The outer part of the separated segment makes a contact with the electric source through carbon brush. The segment moves with the coil and when its' gap between two side remains opposite to the carbon brush, no current will flow. But despite this fact, the movement will remain continue for its inertia and it will get force newly when it will come to the contact of the moving brush. Thus the rotation will remain continue.</p> <p><img alt=\"207_image_0.png\" src=\"207_image_0.png\" /></p> <p><img alt=\"207_image_1.png\" src=\"207_image_1.png\" /></p> <p>Figure:12.8 a, Figure: 12.8 b It is noticeable that though A and B have changed their position, the comutator current will enter from the right side of the loop like before and will come out from the left, (see the figure 12.9) and the coil will rotate clockwise.

The armature is rotated at the uniform speed in mechanical way on the middle of the magnet. The two sides of the rectangular coil are connected to two slip rings. The two slip rings can rotate to same orbit of armature. The two carbon brushes are set in such a way that they touch the two slip rings when the armature is being rotated.

He also observes that the element that emits radiation, transforms totally into a new element. This is a nuclear event. This event is a spontaneous and continuous phenomenon and fully controlled by the nature. Any manmade external influences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase or decrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events. They noticed that similar type of radiation also emits from the heavy elements like Polonium, Thorium and Actinium etc. This radiation is now-a-days known as radioactive rays. The phenomenon of emission of radioactive rays or particles from an element is called radioactivity. Radioactive elements emit three energetic rays, namely alpha, beta and gamma. As a result they transform into lighter elements by the process of disintegration. As the Radium metal transforms into Lead step by step through radioactive disintegration. The unit which is used to measure radioactivity is named Becquerel.</p> <h2>13.2. Properties Of Alpha, Beta And Gamma Rays</h2> <p>Alpha particle: Alpha particle is a Helium nucleus. There are two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus. The penetrating power of alpha particle is less; it cannot pass through 6 cm thick air. These particles are influenced by both the magnetic and electric field. \n",

Its presence can be detected by photographic films, cloud chamber and gold leaf electroscope. These particles create florescence on zinc sulphide screen. The velocity of it is 10% of the velocity of light.</p> <p>Beta particle: These particles are negatively charged and largely deflected by magnetic and electric field. The speed of it is 50% of the speed of light but it can be increased up to 98%. Its mass is the same as that of electron i.e. 9.11×10-31kg. Its existence can be detected by photographic film and cloud chamber. These particles can produce fluorescence. Their penetrating power is more than that of the Alpha particles. The motion of these particles can be stopped by a 3mm thick aluminum sheet. Beta particles can produce enough ionization in a gas. Gamma rays: These rays are charge neutral. This is an electromagnetic wave. It is of short wavelength. It has no mass. It is not deflected by electric and magnetic field. Its speed is same to that of light, which means 3×108 ms-1. Its penetrating power is very high. It can pass through a lead sheet having a few centimeter thickness. Though its ionizing power is less, it can produce fluorescence.

But we can calculate how many atoms will decay in a particular time. A cluster of atoms is considered to study the decay of atoms. The time during which just half of the total number of radioactive atoms undergoes disintegration is called the half-life of that element. As for example, let us assume that there are 800000 atoms in a radioactive element. The time required for the decay of its half i.e. 400000 atoms to transform into a new element is known as its half-life. After a next half-life, there remains 200000 numbers of atoms. After another half-life, the number of atoms will be 100000 and thus it will continue. Here a law of possibility works, which atom will disintegrate when, none can say it.</p> <h2>13.4: Uses Of Radioactivity</h2> <p>There are a lot of uses of radioactivity in medical science, agriculture and industries. In medical science especially to treat incurable cancer, the uses of radioactivity are frequent now-a-days. In medical science, the radioactive isotopes are used as radioactive tracers to diagnose different diseases like blockage of kidney, thyroid problems etc. In agriculture, radioactive tracers are being successfully used, especially to develop high yielding variety of seeds and in the research to produce special type of fertilizer necessary for trees.

It is also used to measure the quantity of different elements in the minerals. Even the radioactive tracers are being used successfully to diagnose diseases.</p> <p>The hands and number of many watches are seen glittering even in the dark. This happens because the hands and the numbers in the watches are covered with a mixture of radioactive thorium and zinc sulfide, as a result they glitter.

The high dose of radioactive radiation can create serious problems in human body. Life killer cancer may cause from this radiation. The preventive power against disease is reduced if someone keeps oneself in close-contact with excessive radioactive radiation for a long time. Man can be mentally disabled; even he may be physically invalid. The harmful effect of radioactivity can be observed from generation to generation.

            " The control of electric current through vacuum tube, special type of crystals and chips is known as electronics. The history of electronics is ancient of more than hundred years. The real journey of electronics begins with the invention of Addison's effect in 1883. When Addison was working with electric lamp, one thing was disturbing him highly. The positive end of the filament of carbon of the lamp was burning again and again. To remove this difficulty, he entered a plate by sealing it with the filament. He saw that when a positive potential is given to the plate with respect to the filament, an electric current flows through the vacuum tube. But when a negative potential is applied to the plate electric current does not flow. Addison explains this phenomenon in this way- as the emitted charge from the hot filament goes to the positive plate, so this charge is negative. If the plate is negative, it repels the emitted charge, as a result no current flows through the circuit. This is known as Addison effect. British physicist Fleming first invented the vacuum tube by using Addison effect. This tube works as a rectifier that means it changes alternating current to direct current. This is the real beginning of electronics. During this time, detector was very necessary for Marconi's Radio. This tube fills up the need of the detector. As there were two electrodes in it, this is called diode. After two years, an American named Lee de Forest invented another vacuum tube called triode. Since it had three electrodes, it was named as triode. Besides anode and cathode, there was another electrode known as grid in it. \n",

The expense of power for it is more, it is less reliable and cooling system is necessary to keep it cool. So the scientists were searching for a semiconductor device as its alternative. Later they invented p-n junction diode. After long experiments, they were able to invent n-p-n transistor. Transistor works as an amplifier.</p> <p>To set up several components in a single motherboard, problem creates. Sometimes it becomes impossible. So, IC or integrated circuit is invented. IC is such a creation using semiconductors like silicon, where millions of microscopic electric circuits are gathered in a place like a nail of our finger.

The word 'digital' comes from the word digit. Digital signal means such a communicative signal which can receive some definite value. These can be changed into discrete values and each of them can be identified separately. In this system, with the help of binary code i.e. 0 and 1, any information, number, letter or any special signal etc. can be understood or sent. \n",

These are: the qualitative standard of the signal, the elements to maintain the process and cost or expense.</p> <p>Digital signal is the best to send a signal to a long distance. If the distance is long, the power of analogue signal decreases gradually. Then to sustain the analogue signal, amplification has to be done. As a result noise increases, and the quality of the signal is reduced or distorted and it can be fully lost. But the digital signal is amplified on the way. As a result the signal remains unchanged. Digital signal is used to transmit a signal through an optical fiber, since the qualitative standard of the last signal remains unchanged. Besides many signal can be sent in every second. \n",

Cross connection may be occurred in analogue device but it cannot be happened in digital system.</p> <h2>13.8. Semiconductor And Integrated Circuit</h2> <p>Semiconductor: There are some materials (such as- silicon and germanium) which are neither good conductor nor insulator. These are called semiconductors. Pure semiconductor works as an insulator when it is cold. At normal room temperature it behaves slightly as a conductor. But the conductivity of semiconductor can be increased by adding some definite elements with it. Semiconductor is divided into n-type and ptype on the basis of the elements added to it. Negative and positive charge carriers are denoted by n-type and p-type respectively. The semiconductor made by the addition of phosphorous with silicon is an example of n-type material. The presence of phosphorous atoms increases the number of negatively charged electrons which can move freely in the substance. The semiconductor made by the addition of boron with silicon is the example of p-type material. The boron atoms create gap or positive holes in the electronic structure of atom. The electrons move from one hole to another by jumping within the material. If an n-type material is sandwiched with a p-type material, a very necessary device is developed which is called a p-n junction diode. It works as a rectifier. Diode makes the electric current unidirectional i.e. the diode transforms the alternating current (AC) into a direct current (DC). \n",

The instrument which performs this work is called an amplifier. Transistor is such a device which works as an amplifier and high speed switch. A transistor is made when a p-type substance is introduced between two n-type materials like a sandwich. These three layers are called collector, base and emitter. The two n-type regions are the emitter and collector and the narrow p-type region is the base of the</p> <p>Fig: 13.5: Transistor and its symbol transistor.</p> <p>At the same way, transistor is made by using p-type and n-type semiconductor. Here ptype regions are the collector and emitter and n-type region is the base.</p> <p>Transistor is used to amplify the electric current.</p> <p>Integrated circuit: Integrated circuit is commonly known as IC. IC is used in most of the electronic appliances starting from computer, mobile phone to microoven which we see around us. IC is such a creation using semiconductor like silicon where millions of microscopic electronic circuits are gathered in a place like the nail of our finger. \n",
            "Chunk 422:\n",
            " Revolutionary changes took place in the design of IC chips after its invention in 1960. At the early stage, there were hundreds of circuits or components organized in the IC chips. The number reaches to thousands by 1970. At that time IC was used only in computers and pocket calculators. At present, a single IC chip can contain millions of components which are able to operate or drive many complex devices or machines. The famous Intel chip is an example of it. The interesting matter is that as the number of components is increasing, the size of the chips is getting smaller and the standard of the devices is being developed.</p> <p>If the IC chips were not invented and developed, we would not get creative devices like mobile phone, internet, MP-3 player and so on. The modern IC chips have brought a revolution and given us many facilities and comforts.</p> <h2>13.9. Microphone And Speaker</h2> <p>Microphone is orally known as mike. In a big meeting or program, a speaker delivers his speech in front of an electronic device which is known as microphone or mike.</p> <p>Microphone converts sound into an electric signal. The audience can hear it loudly through a loud speaker. Because the speaker transforms the electric signal of microphone into sound. Perhaps you will have seen the use of microphone and speaker in various ceremonies of your school. Both microphones and speakers are found in tape-recorder, VCR etc.</p> <h2>Microphone And Its Functions</h2> <p>We have already said that microphone is such a device that changes sound wave into electrical audio wave or signal. \n",
            "Chunk 423:\n",
            " The frequency and relative amplitude of the electrical audio signal remain the same as that of the sound wave.</p> <p>There is a moving coil and a thin metallic sheet named diaphragm in the microphone. When a person speaks through a microphone, the diaphragm vibrates by the sound wave. Diaphragm is that part of the microphone which is designed to transform the vibration of sound into electricity. The vibration of different types of sounds vibrates the diaphragm differently. This vibration makes the diaphragm Fig: 13.6 Microphone move to and fro in the magnetic field. As a result, alternating electric current is induced in the moving coil. Thus microphone converts the sound energy into electrical energy. This is called audio signal. Having amplified, this electric audio signal can be transferred to a long distance through a telephone line or radio. So microphone plays a vital role in television and radio broadcasting, recording and telephone. Speaker: Speaker does just the opposite task of the microphone.</p> <p>Speaker converts the electric signal of microphone into corresponding sound wave. Functions of speaker: Most of the loudspeakers are moving coil loudspeaker. It has1. A cylindrical permanent magnet which produces a strong magnetic field.</p> <p><img alt=\"220_image_0.png\" src=\"220_image_0.png\" /></p> <ol> <li> <p>A small coil or wire-loop is suspended. \n",

For this reason, the paper cone is vibrated. As a result, sound is produced.</p> <h2>13.10 Information And Communication Technology</h2> <p>At present, information and communication technology is a very popular subject. Starting from simple works of our daily life we can do very important tasks of our professional life by using information and communication technology easily.</p> <p>Communications have greatly influenced the life of human being at the beginning of 20th and 21st century. In 19th century, the development and expansion of telephone and telegraph has taken communication power of human one step forward. In 20th century radio, television, cell-phone, fax-machine have brought a revolution in the field of communication. After these, computer and internet have made great contribution to the development of communication.</p> <p>Radio: Radio is a wide and important medium of entertainment and communication. We can hear news, song, music, drama, discussion, debate and the advertisements of industrial products. Radio is used to exchange information in army and police department. Radio technology is used in the field of mobile or cellular phone communication. \n",

How is this sound sent and how can we hear it? In the studio of a radio-telecast station, a person speaks before the microphone. Microphone converts that sound into electric wave. This wave is known as audio signal. The frequency or power of this signal is very weak and its frequency range is 20 hertz to 20000 hertz. This wave cannot go far. So this information carrying low frequency wave is mixed with high frequency electromagnetic wave. This high frequency electromagnetic wave is called carrier wave. This combined wave is called modulated wave. The process of mixing these two waves is called modulation. This modulated wave is also called radio wave. Radio wave is amplified with the help of an amplifier and transmitted to space as electromagnetic wave with the help of antenna of the transmitter. \n",
            "Chunk 426:\n",
            " This radio wave spreads out in the space and it is divided into two waves called Ground wave and Sky wave. Ground wave directly reaches to the aerial of receiver. The radio set in our house is a radio wave receiver. The sky wave comes back to the earth by being reflected at the ionosphere and is received by Ariel of the receiver.</p> <p>The receiver receives the radio wave and converts into electrical signal. After that the sound wave is separated from the carrier wave by the process of demodulation. Later electrical signal is amplified with the help of amplifier and is sent to loudspeaker.</p> <p>Loudspeaker again changes the electrical signal into sound. We can hear this sound. So, the sound is not transmitted from the transmitter to the radio. The sound wave is sent by changing it into electromagnetic wave, the receiver receives the radio wave, the loudspeaker changes it into sound.</p> <p><img alt=\"221_image_0.png\" src=\"221_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>Figure: 13.9</p> <p><img alt=\"221_image_1.png\" src=\"221_image_1.png\" /></p> <p>Television: Television is such a device by which we can hear the sound and watch the picture of the speakers on the screen from distant place. In 1926, Logy Beard was able to send pictures on television. \n",

To send the sound and picture on television, there are separate transmitters in the transmitting station by which sound and picture can be sent in the form of electromagnetic wave.</p> <p><img alt=\"222_image_0.png\" src=\"222_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>Figure: 13.10 Pictures are transformed into electrical signals and then sent with the help of one of the transmitters. With the help of another transmitter pictures are transformed into electrical signals and then transmitted them in the form of electromagnetic wave. At first we should discuss about sending and receiving picture. The pictures or the scenery are to be sent has to be converted into electrical signals by the TV camera. This signal is mixed with a high frequency carrier in the modulation process. Afterwards it is sent in the form of electromagnetic radio wave with the help of an antenna.</p> <p>TV set receives electromagnetic carrier wave for the picture with the help of antenna.</p> <p>Rectifier separates video electrical signal from the carrier wave. This electrical signal is amplified by an amplifier and it is sent to the electron gun. This electron gun is attached to the back of the picture tube of the television. After receiving the video signal, the electron gun shoots the narrow electron beam like a needle. When the electron beam from the electron gun incidents on the fluorescent phosphor screen of the TV, then flash of light is created. \n",
            "Chunk 428:\n",
            " With the combination of these bright and dark spots, bright and dark light spots and flashes are created on the TV screen. The picture sent from the camera is seen on the TV screen with the combination of these bright and dark spots. This forms 25 still picture on the TV screen in every second which our eyes see as moving picture.</p> <h2>Transmitting And Receiving Of Sound</h2> <p>The picture which will be sent to television and the sound associated are converted into electrical signal with the help of microphone. This electric wave is mixed with a high frequency electromagnetic wave known as carrier wave and it is transmitted with the help of transmitter.</p> <p>The TV set that we use in our house has separate processes of receiving sound and picture signal. The electromagnetic wave comes to our TV antenna sent by the transmitter and creates electric current. This electric current reaches the receiver of television set passing through the wires. The sound receiving receiver of the television set receives this electrical signal and amplifies it. Later it is sent to the loudspeaker which converts this electrical signal into original sound .We can hear this sound.</p> <p>Generally these are the functions of black and white television. Colour television: There are no major differences between the basic principles of colour TV and Black and White TV. There are three separate electron guns in the camera of colour television for three basic colours (Red, Blue and Green) . There are also three electron guns in the receiving machine of colour television. The screen of colour television is made of three kinds of phosphor granules. A particular colour illuminates the phosphor granules of that particular colour. \n",

It is used to communicate, send E-mail, Fax, and for computer communication etc. with any other country.</p> <p>Alexander Graham Bell invented Telephone in 1875. Through many evolutions, the telephone invented by Graham Bell has reached to the modern dimensions and cordless, cellular and mobile-phone has been made.</p> <h2>How Does Telephone Work</h2> <p>In every telephone set, there is a system of receiving and transmitting signal. The mouthpiece of a telephone is microphone, it is the transmitter and the ear-piece is a speaker, and is the receiver. There is a ringer for making the ringing sound and a dialing system in a telephone set. When we speak, the microphone of the mouthpiece converts our voice into electrical signal. This signal reaches to the ear-piece of another telephone through the telephone wire. The speaker of the earpiece converts the electrical signal into sound. As a result, the caller or the called person can hear the sound and answer. \n",

            " This answer of the called person returns to the telephone set of the caller after being converted into electrical signal with the help of microphone of the mouthpiece and it is transformed into sound in the speaker of the earpiece of the caller, then the caller hears the speech of the called person.</p> <p>The electrical signal travels so fast through the telephone wire that it does not delay any single moment to transfer. Every telephone set is connected</p> <p><img alt=\"223_image_0.png\" src=\"223_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>Figure: 13.11 Function of land telephone to the main regional office through wire. The connection with other telephone set is established through the regional head-office. Cell phone or mobile phone: Cell phone or Mobile phone is the most popular and widely used medium of communication of present time.  You can not only communicate with other but also, can play games, download music, songs, hear music, watch film and use internet with the help of it. Besides, you can make cash payment, pay bill, check in at the airport and apply for the admission in a college or university using this phone.</p> <p>You can communicate from one corner of the country to another over phone.</p> <h2>Making And Receiving Phone Call In Mobile:</h2> <p>This phone is not connected to another phone with wire. This type of phone sends and receives information or speech with the help of radio signal instead of wire. \n",

Then the call travels to the mobile switch station through Figure: 13.13 Mobile Network</p> <p><img alt=\"224_image_0.png\" src=\"224_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>micro wave or wire. This station sends this call to the local telephone exchange. There the call reaches to the called person as a telephone call. Most of the mobile phones at present work with the combination of sending radio wave and telephone circuit switching. Fax: Fax is the short form of facsimile. It is used to send a document as it is, without any change.</p> <p>What is Fax: Fax is such an electronic system through which any information, picture diagram or writing can be sent by copying it as it is. Any original document can be reproduced with the help of this machine. Though the fax machine was invented in 1842, its journey started in 1930.

We need a healthy, strong and disease free body to survive. To keep a sound health we need proper treatment. In medical science, proper diagnosis is an important issue. Different types of medical instruments are prepared based on different theories and principles of physics. These devices function by utilizing different principles and theories of physics. A few of such instruments will be discussed in this chapter.] By the end of this chapter we will be able to1.

            " Theories and methods of physical science are employed in biophysics to study a system of biology. Biology is the science of studying living world.</p> <p>How plants and animals collect food, communicate, percept from the environment and reproduce are discussed in biology. On the other hand the mathematical rule which nature follows is the subject-matter of physics. For a long period, the scientists believed that the laws of living world and physical world are different. But with the progress of physical and biological science, a deep harmony is found between these two apparently different disciplines. At first physics and biology has evolved as two different subjects. The mutual relationship and coordination between these two subjects has increased a lot with the advancement of science. It was thought before that living world follows a different rule and the laws of physical science are applicable only for the inanimate objects. But now we know that the animal body can be compared to a machine from many aspects and it is possible to explain many behaviors of animal body with the help of physical laws. Actually, the laws of physics are universal. So, not only the physical world, but also the animal kingdom can be explained with the help of physics in many cases. This is the basis of bio-physics.</p> <p>The challenge of bio-physics is to explain different complexities of life on the basis of simple laws of physics. Bio-physics is a powerful tool to reach at the depth of life by investigating different secrets of life and analyzing different events using mathematics and physics. \n",

            " Bio-physics is a bridge between biology and physics.</p> <h2>14.2 Contributions Of Jagadish Chandra Bose</h2> <p>Acharya Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose was a physicist as well as a biologist. In our subcontinent he is the first internationally recognized scientist. Bose family hailed  from the village Rarikhal of Bikrampur under district of Dhaka. He was born in Mymensingh on 30th November, 1958. His father Bhagawan Chandra Bose was a deputy magistrate in the district of Faridpur. Bose's education started at a vernacular school in Faridpur. Next he got admitted to Hare school and Saint Xavier's school and college in Kolkata and passed his student life. After completing B.A. he went to England for higher study in the year 1880. His student life in England was from 1880 to 1884. He completed the B.A. degree with honours in physics from University of Cambridge and a B. Sc. degree from University of London. In 1885, he started as a professor of physics in Presidency College. Though there were not adequate facilities of research in Presidency College, he carried out his research work. As there was scarcity of time in day, he had to conduct his research work in night many times. In the laboratory he researched a lot about, how radio signals can be transmitted to a distant place without the help of wire and succeeded. In 1895, for the first time in history he sent radio signal to a distant place without wire and demonstrated in public. He has mentionable contributions in microwave research. \n",

            " He was the first who was able to reduce the wavelength of generated wave to millimeter level (about 5 mm). He was the first to use a semiconductor junction to detect radio signal. Instead of taking commercial benefit from this invention, he opened it for all, so that others can develop this research more. Subsequently, Jagadish Chandra Bose made a number of important and pioneering discoveries in plant</p> <p><img alt=\"233_image_0.png\" src=\"233_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>physiology. Among these, invention of crescograph to record the growth of plants, extremely slight movement and how plants respond to various stimuli are notable.</p> <p>His major contribution in the field of bio-physics is the nature of conduction of the stimuli in plants. Earlier it was thought that, the nature of response of plants to different stimuli is chemical, but he became able to show that it is electric in nature.</p> <p>In 1917 he established 'Bose Biggan Mandir' in Kolkata in order to research about plant physiology. His writings in Bengali language are compiled in a book named 'Abyakta'. \n",

            " 'Response in the Living and Non-Living' is a mentionable book of him.</p> <p>Jagadish Chandra Bose expired dated on 23rd November 1937.</p> <h2>14.3 Human Body And Machine</h2> <p>We use different types of devices to meet our various needs of everyday life such asautomobiles, refrigerator, television, steam engine, internal combustion engine etc. Many people designated human body as a machine. Though human body is not a machine at all, it behaves as a machine in many aspects. As like as a machine, it is also made up of many small parts or organs, absence or infirmity of one organ the activities of the whole body is disturbed. Each part of the body, like each part of a machine, does special jobs. Each organ of human body is interconnected with other organs, each organ runs at its own individual speed, but all function in a specific way and there is a predetermined relationship to each other. In this sense, the human body is analogous to the most complicated man-made machines. Heart, kidneys, lungs, liver etc. are such parts of human body. As for example- heart is actually an automatic pump, which is able to circulate blood throughout the whole body by its own electric signal without any external stimulation. On the contrary, kidney is a special filtration machine which eliminates the nitrogenated waste materials of the body.</p> <p>Due to the coordination of functions of such small machines the whole human body remains active.</p> <p>Human body is like an organic machine. \n",
            "Chunk 446:\n",
            " Energy is needed in a machine to do work. In different engines using fuels like petrol, diesel, CNG etc. we convert chemical energy into mechanical energy. Similarly, human body also transforms chemical energy into mechanical and heat energy by food ingestion and respiration. Therefore, human body is like an organic machine in fact. But, in many aspects, human body is more amazing than the most complex machine made by humans. Human body can perform such functions which is not possible for any machine. For instance- human body develops from only one cell. With the passage of time, this single cell transforms into a complete human body, which is build with thousand billions of cells. But this doesn't happen in case of any machine. Sometimes functions of the whole body stops due to infirmity of only one part of the body. For example- when function of the heart stops, functions of all other parts of the body stops too, and functions of the brain also stops very quickly.</p> <h2>14.4 Instruments Used For Diagnosis Of Diseases</h2> <p>Once the doctors were used to identifying diseases by observing different external symptoms of the patients and prescribed medicine and diet accordingly. Modern instruments to identify diseases were not invented at that time. As a result, it was not possible to locate the exact positions of different organs. In addition, in which degree a particular organ of the patient is infected was not possible to know. Various types of instruments are invented utilizing different technologies of science to diagnose diseases.</p> <p>With the help of these instruments it became possible to determine diseases properly. \n",
            "Chunk 447:\n",
            " It is impossible for a doctor to identify a disease without the right instrument, which is necessary to perform that particular test. The specific cause for a particular disease became known to us due to the invention of different devices. Once people used to believe different superstitions related to disease due to ignorance. In the modern society, the mortality rate is decreased by a large amount. The principal reason behind this is that physical instruments are being used for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment. In this section, some of the instruments which are generally used for diagnosis of diseases are discussed.</p> <h2>X-Ray</h2> <p>X-ray is a kind of electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength of X-ray is much lesser than that of the ordinary light. Its wavelength is about 1010 m. X-ray was invented by Wilhelm Roentgen in 1895. Another name of Roentgen ray is X-ray. When the nature of Roentgen ray was not known, for being an unknown ray it was named X-ray. The power of X-ray to penetrate any material becomes more as its wavelength gets smaller.</p> <p>Ordinary light is visible and divided into different colours, but X-ray is invisible. If an opaque medium is placed in the path of ordinary light, it cannot penetrate the medium.</p> <p>On the other hand X-ray has high penetrating power. X-ray is produced in an X-ray tube.</p> <p>X-ray tube is a vacuum glass tube. There are two electrodes placed at the two ends of the glass tube. \n",
            "Chunk 448:\n",
            " One of them is called cathode and the other is anode. There is a coil made of tungsten in cathode which is called filament. The cathode is heated by the current flowing through the filament. As a result, the electrons are freed and come out. If a high potential difference is applied between the electrodes, the electrons are accelerated with very high speed and hit the target anode. Due to this, the motion of electrons suddenly stops and X-ray is produced. Here, the kinetic energy of electrons transforms into electromagnetic wave. This radiation of small wavelength is the X-ray. Therefore, if electrons with high speed strike a metal, then a type of radiation of unknown nature having high penetrating power and of very small wavelength is produced from the metal. This radiation is called is called X-ray. In figure 14.1 the essential parts of an X-ray tube are shown.</p> <p><img alt=\"235_image_1.png\" src=\"235_image_1.png\" /></p> <p>Figure: 14.2 Figure: 14.1 X-ray is used for various purposes. \n",

            " It has tremendous contributions to diagnose diseases in medical science.</p> <p>1.</p> <p>Displaced bones, cracks in bone, bone fracture etc. can be identified very easily with the help of X-ray.</p> <ol> <li></li> </ol> <p>X-ray can be used to diagnose any type of disease in face, for example- to identify ulcer and decay at the root of tooth X-ray is used.</p> <p>Intestinal obstruction can be identified by X-ray of abdomen.</p> <p>3.</p> <p>The stones present in the gall bladder and kidneys can be identified by X-ray.</p> <p>ব 5. The diseases of lungs like pneumonia; lung cancer etc. can be traced by X-ray of chest.</p> <ol> <li>X-ray is also used for treatment purpose. It can kill cancer cells. Cancer can be treated using radiotherapy. Necessary precautions should be taken so that unnecessary exposure of X-ray radiation cannot harm the patient. For this, the patient should be covered with apron made of lead as much as possible. X-ray of abdomen and pelvic region of pregnant women should not be done except in case of emergency. \n",
            "Chunk 450:\n",
            " Apron made of lead must be used for other X-ray tests.</li> </ol> <p><img alt=\"235_image_0.png\" src=\"235_image_0.png\" /></p> <h2>Ultra Sonography</h2> <p>Ultra sonography is a procedure that depends on the reflection of sound of high frequency. When sound wave of high frequency is reflected from an organ or muscle within the body, then an image analogous to that organ is formed in the monitor by the reflected waves.</p> <p>The frequency of the ultrasound is 1-10 MHz which is used for diagnosis of diseases. In an ultra sonography machine, the high frequency ultrasonic waves are produced by electrically stimulating a crystal called a transducer. In an ultra sonography machine, the ultrasonic waves are transformed into a narrow beam. Next this beam is directed toward the organ whose image is to be recorded.</p> <p>The beam is reflected, absorbed or transmitted by the organ toward which they are directed, depending on the nature of the surface they strike.</p> <p>As the beam strikes an interface or boundary between tissues of varying density (e.g., muscle and blood) part of the sound waves are reflected back to the transducer as echoes. \n",
            "Chunk 451:\n",
            " The echoes are then converted into electrical impulses that are displayed on a monitor presenting a 'picture' of the organ or muscle under examination.</p> <p>Figure: 14.3 Ultrasonography</p> <p><img alt=\"236_image_0.png\" src=\"236_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>The most important use of ultra sonography is in the field of obstetrics and gynecology.</p> <p>With this, the fetal size, maturity and normal and abnormal position of fetus can be known. It is a fast, relatively safe, and reliable technique in the field of gynecology.</p> <p>Uterine tumors and other pelvic masses can be identified by ultra sonography.</p> <p>Ultra sonogram is used in medical tests of different kinds, such as- gall bladder stone, defect in the heart and identification of tumors. When ultrasound is used for examination of the heart, then it is called echocardiography. Ultra sonography is a safer diagnosing method in comparison to X-ray. Yet, it is to be used for a very limited time. Besides, the transducer should always be kept in movement, so that it does not become static at any position.</p> <h2>Ct Scan</h2> <p>CT scan stands for Computed Tomography Scan. In medical science it is the process of creating image. Tomography is the process of generating a two-dimensional image of a slice or section through a 3-dimensional object. \n",
            "Chunk 452:\n",
            " CT scanner is a large machine and uses X-rays. Where X-ray forms a two dimensional image of a three dimensional organ inside the body, there the image formed by CT scan machine is three dimensional.</p> <p>The CT scan machine uses digital geometry processing to generate a three dimensional of the inside of an object. The three dimensional image is made after many 2dimensional X-ray images are taken around a single axis of rotation. This job is done using a computer. A CT scanner emits a series of narrow beams through the human body as it moves through an arc. While an X-ray machine sends just one X-ray beam through the body of the patient. As a result, the final picture formed by CT scan is far more distinct and detailed than an X-ray one. The X-ray detector used in a CT scanner can detect hundreds of different levels of density in patient's body. This data collected by the detector is transmitted to a computer. Computer builds up a three dimensional picture of the part of the body and displays it on the screen. Three dimensional images of soft tissue, blood carrying veins or arteries, lungs, brain, etc. is obtained by CT scan. CT scan is used for detection of cancer in lever, lungs and pancreas. The image obtained by CT scan helps a physician to detect tumor, to determine the size and position of the tumor and how much the tumor infected the adjacent tumor. By the CT scan of head, any type of bleeding inside the brain, swelling of artery and existence of tumor can be detected. Whether there is a problem in the blood circulation is also known by the CT scan. \n",
            "Chunk 453:\n",
            " Generally CT scan test is not done in case of pregnant women. If dye is used in CT scan test there is a possibility of allergic reaction.</p> <p><img alt=\"237_image_0.png\" src=\"237_image_0.png\" /></p> <h2>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Mri)</h2> <p>MRI is the abbreviated form of the English term 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging'. In MRI machine extended image of an organ or place of the body is formed utilizing strong magnetic field and radio wave. MRI machine works depending on the physical and chemical principles of 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance'. Using this principle, information about the nature of any molecule can be known. MRI is a painless and safe disease diagnosis method. X-ray or any other kind of radiation is not used in this machine. The signals received from the part of the body which is scanned with MRI are transformed using computers and a very distinct image of that part of the body is formed. Each individual image acts as a slice of the organ of the body. Thus a number of images are formed, which exhibits all the characteristics of that part of the body.</p> <p><img alt=\"238_image_0.png\" src=\"238_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>Figure 14.5: MRI machine The image obtained by MRI can be compared to each individual slice of bread. When one slice of the bread is picked up, then the interior part of the bread can be seen along with the slice. \n",
            "Chunk 454:\n",
            " Similarly, each image found by MRI helps to view everything inside the body. The intensity of the wound is determined using MRI in case of twisting of ankles and back pain. MRI is an extremely valuable test to form an extended image of brain and spinal cord.</p> <h2>Ecg</h2> <p>ECG is the abbreviated form of the word electrocardiogram. ECG is a diagnostic procedure that is routinely used to assess the electrical and muscular functions of the heart. We know that the heart produces tiny electrical impulses without any external stimulation. This electrical signal spread through the heart muscle to make the heart contract. We detect these impulses by the ECG machine. With the help of ECG we can measure the rate and rhythms of heartbeats. It gives indirect evidence of blood flow in the heart. The electrodes placed on the different parts of the body detect the electrical impulses coming from different directions within the heart. To get a complete picture of the heart, twelve signals are identified using ten electrodes. An electrode lead is placed on each arm and leg i.e. total of four and rest six electrodes are placed across the chest wall [Figure 14.6]. The signals received from each electrode are recorded. The printed view of these recordings is the electro gram.</p> <p><img alt=\"239_image_0.png\" src=\"239_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>Figure 14.6: ECG procedure For a healthy person, there are normal patterns of the electrical impulses from each electrode. \n",
            "Chunk 455:\n",
            " If any type of abnormal condition is observed in the heart of a person, then the patterns from the electrodes will be different from that of a normal pattern.</p> <p>Generally, ECG test is done to find the cause of external symptoms such as- palpitations, irregular and fast heart beat, chest pain etc. of some diseases. Sometimes it is done as a part of routine tests- for example, before you have an operation you can take the help of ECG.</p> <p>The heart disorders that can be detected by ECG are: 1.</p> <p>Abnormal heart rhythms- for example, if the heart is very fast, very slow or irregular.</p> <ol> <li>A heart attack- which happened recent or some time ago.</li> </ol> <p>An enlarged heart- i.e. the size of the heart is increased.</p> <p>3.</p> <h2>Endoscopy</h2> <p>Generally endoscopy means looking inside something. But by endoscopy we mean looking interior of a hollow organ or cavity of the body for medical reasons using an endoscope machine. \n",
            "Chunk 456:\n",
            " We examine the interior side of hollow organs of our body using endoscope machine.</p> <p>Figure: 14.7 Endoscopy</p> <p><img alt=\"239_image_1.png\" src=\"239_image_1.png\" /></p> <p>In an endoscope machine, there are two tubes. Through one of them light is transferred to a definite organ of patient's body from outside. Due to the total internal reflection of light on the inner wall of the optical fiber, bright light enters the body cavity of patient.</p> <p>This light illuminates the diseased or injured organ. The reflected part of light returns back through the second fiber optic tube in the same way. The reflected light enters the eyes of doctors through the eyepiece lens. As a result, the doctor can see what is happening inside the examined organ. Endoscopy allows doctors to check for any type of irritation, ulcer, inflammation and abnormal tissue growth in the internal organ. \n",
            "Chunk 457:\n",
            " Endoscopy is used to examine a number of different organs, including: (A) the lungs, central partition of the chest; (B) the stomach, small intestine, large intestine or colon; (C) the female reproductive organ; (D) the abdomen and pelvis; (E) the inside of urinary bladder; (F) the nasal cavity and sinuses surrounding the nose; (G) the ears.</p> <h2>Radiotherapy</h2> <p>The word radiotherapy is the abbreviated form of the word 'Radiation therapy'.</p> <p>Different diseases like cancer, abnormal nature of thyroid gland, some diseases concerning blood are treated using it. Generally radiotherapy destroys cancer cells utilizing highly energized X-ray. It destroys the power of multiplication of the cells by damaging the DNA inside the tumor cell. Mainly, it is the application of ionizing (radioactive) radiation in the treatment of disease. Radiotherapy is of two types: 1. External beam radiation or external radiotherapy 2. Internal radiotherapy In case of external radiotherapy highly energized X-ray, cobalt radiation, electron or proton beams are applied from outside the body. The beam is applied directing to that site of the body where the tumor is located. As a result, the growth and power of multiplication of the cancer cells get destroyed. In this process a very few number of healthy cells also get affected. Yet, our aim is to destroy cancer cells as many as possible than the healthy cells. \n",
            "Chunk 458:\n",
            " Most of the healthy cells that got damaged can repair themselves.</p> <p>Figure 14.8: Radiotherapy machine</p> <p><img alt=\"240_image_0.png\" src=\"240_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>In case of internal radiotherapy, radiotherapy is applied from inside the body of a patient. In this process patient takes radioactive liquids as drinks or radioactive liquids are introduced to the body of patient through injection. Radioactive phosphorus in case of blood cancer, radioactive strontium in bone cancer and radioactive iodine in thyroid cancer is used in the liquid. This process is called brachytherapy.</p> <p>ETT ETT is the short form of 'Exercise Tolerance Test'. It is a test of the stimulated heart.</p> <p>Electric activities or functions (rate or rhythm) of the heart during exercise are recorded by ETT. In fact, it is an ECG test of the patient while doing exercise. This test is very important for identifying the diseases related to coronary artery. \n",

            " During this test, extra stress of exercise is imposed on the heart.</p> <p><img alt=\"241_image_0.png\" src=\"241_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>Figure 14.9: ETT test Partial blockage developed in the coronary arteries of heart is identified by this test.</p> <p>Generally, this type of abnormal condition in patient's body cannot be identified while taking rest.</p> <p>During the test, the patient is instructed to ride a stationary bicycle or to walk continuously on a treadmill machine. The physician records the ECG of the patient during exercise. By adjusting the speed of rotation of the wheel and slope of the surface, the degree of stress is gradually increased. Physicians become able to identify the changes that occur in the patient's heart during exercise through ETT.</p> <h2>Angiography</h2> <p>Angiography is such an imaging test where X-ray is used to view the blood vessels of the body. This test is used to study whether the arteries or veins are narrow, blocked or enlarged in the body. The normal flow of blood is obstructed in the body when the blood vessels are blocked and they are narrow or not wide. During angiogram the physicians inject a liquid through a thin and flexible tube into the patient's body. The liquid is called 'dye' and the tube is called 'catheter'. The blood vessels become visible on an X- ray due to the use of dye. \n",
            "Chunk 460:\n",
            " This dye is later eliminated from the body through kidneys and urine. Through a definite entry point the catheter is introduced into a definite artery or vein. The entry point may be in any blood vessel of the body. Sometimes, the 'dye' used is also termed as 'contrast'.</p> <p><img alt=\"242_image_0.png\" src=\"242_image_0.png\" /></p> <p>The causes for which the physicians generally recommend an angiogram are as follows- A. Blockages of the arteries outside the heart.</p> <p>B. Enlargement of the arteries C. For understanding the kidney artery conditions D.  Problems with veins Sometimes the physicians can also treat a blockage in a blood vessel without any surgery during an angiogram. The mechanism or the procedure following which the blocked arteries are cleared during an angiogram is called angioplasty.</p> <h2>Isotopes And Its Uses</h2> <p>Isotopes are the variants of a definite element. Atoms of the same element having different mass number are called isotopes. That is, in isotopes of an element, the number of protons is same but the number of neutron is different. The number of protons in the nucleus of atom of an element identifies the element uniquely. But in principle, an element may have any number of neutrons. The total number of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus of an element is its mass number. For this reason, each isotope of an element has different mass number. \n",

            " Carbon can be considered as an example. Three an clement ime r respectively. The atomic number of carbon is 6, i.e. there are six protons in each carbon atom. As a result, the number of neutrons in the isotopes of carbon is 6, 7 and 8 respectively.</p> <p>In the field of medical science, radioactive isotopes are widely used in nuclear medicine. Radioisotopes have two types of applications.</p> <p>A. For diagnosis purpose B. For treatment purpose The presence of harmful cancer tumor anywhere in the body or in an organ can be identified by radioisotopes. The energetic gamma rays emitted from the isotope Co-60 is used for the treatment of cancer. The gamma rays emitted from Co-60 is used to sterilize surgical instruments. Iodine-131 (131) is used for the treatment of the abnormal growth of the thyroid gland. Technetium-99m is the most widely used radioactive isotope for diagnostic studies in nuclear medicine. Technetium is used for brain, bone, liver and spleen imaging or scanning. Blood- Leucaemia caused by excess of white blood cell is treated with phosphate of radioactive phosphorus-32. In nuclear medicine, radioisotopes are introduced into the body of the patient through the veins to diagnose diseases. The radioactive materials are selected depending on the organ which will be examined.</p> <p>Besides these, radioisotopes are widely used in the field of agriculture, food preservation, controlling pests and industries.</p> <h2>Exercise</h2> <p>A. \n",

Rotational motion : When a body rotates around a particular point or an axis keeping the distance of the particles of the body unchanged is called rotational motion. For example, motion of an electric fan, motion of the heads of a clock.</p> <p>Rectilinear motion : When a body moves along a straight line in such a way that each particle of the body travels the same distance at the same time in the same direction. If a book is pushed to shift from one end to the other of a table without rotation, the motion will be rectilinear because all the particles of the book travel the equal distance, at equal time in the same direction.</p> <p>Periodic motion : If the motion of a moving particle is such that it passes through a definite point along the path of its motion in the same direction in a definite interval of time, this type of motion is called periodic motion. This motion can be circular, elliptical or rectilinear. The motion of the hands of a clock, the motion of earth round the sun, the motion of piston in the cylinder of a steam or petrol engine etc.</p> <p>The time interval at which a particle of periodic motion passes through a definite point from the same direction repeatedly is called its time period. Vibratory motion : If a body executing periodic motion moves in a definite direction for one half of its time period and exactly for the other half in the opposite direction then this motion is called vibratory motion.

If no vernier mark coincide with a main scale mark then find out the nearest vernier mark. The reading of this mark that is the number of vernier scale divisions from the left to this mark, is the vernier scale reading.</p> <p>Suppose the Vth vernier mark coincides with or nearest with any main scale mark.

If Mitu covers the same distance in 40 seconds, who goes faster ? Ovi or Mitu, definitely Mitu goes faster because she takes less time. Suppose, Ovi travels 100m in 50 seconds, Mitu travels 75m in 30 seconds can we say Ovi goes slower than Mitu ? Does not Ovi travel more distance than Mitu ?

        "1. Carefully read the entire question and identify all parts that need to be answered.\n",
        "2. Give yourself room to think by extracting relevant passages from the context before answering the query.\n",
        "3. Present a clear and concise solution without unnecessary filler text.\n",
        "4. Use a structured approach to problem-solving:\n",
        "   a) **List given information**\n",
        "   b) **State the correct formula(s)**, making sure signs are appropriately used\n",
        "   c) **Explain why the chosen formula** is suitable for this problem\n",

        "   e) **Perform all necessary calculations** for each part of the question\n",
        "   f) **State and explain the final answer** based on the calculations\n",
        "5. Ensure you complete **all** calculations requested in the question. Double-check that you've addressed every part of the query.\n",
        "6. **Never stop** at explanation; make sure you conclude who or what satisfies the query.\n",
        "7. **Always base your conclusion on the calculations you performed**, even if it differs from examples in the textbook.\n",
        "8. Use the formatting instructions provided (Markdown headers, LaTeX for equations, etc.)\n",
        "9. Explain your reasoning clearly, making the solution process easy to follow.\n",
        "10. If you cannot answer the question from the given context of the book, say: \"Sorry, I cannot answer this question as it is not covered in your textbook.\"\n",
        "11. **For math problems**, state the symbols for the terms, e.g., Distance = *s*, and then calculate using the symbols.\n",
        "12. Make sure your answers are as explanatory as possible.\n",
        "13. Before concluding, **review the original question** to ensure all parts have been answered. If any part is missing, complete the calculation and add it to your response.\n",
        "14. For follow-up questions, first search for the context in your past conversations and then refer to the book.\n",
