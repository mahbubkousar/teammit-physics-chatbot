"Why do passengers in a bus lean backwards when the bus starts moving?","Passengers lean backwards due to the inertia of rest, as the upper part of their body tends to remain stationary while the lower part moves with the bus.","Explanatory","Easy","2024-10-26 07:02:11"
"Why do passengers in a bus lean forwards when the bus suddenly stops?","Passengers lean forwards due to the inertia of motion, as the upper part of their body moves forward while the lower part becomes stationary with the bus.","Explanatory","Easy","2024-10-26 07:02:11"
"What is the role of inertia in a moving object?","Inertia plays a crucial role in a moving object, as it tends to maintain the object's state of motion, making it difficult to change its velocity or direction.","Explanatory","Easy","2024-10-26 07:02:11"
"Can a body change its state of motion without any external force?","No, a body cannot change its state of motion without any external force, due to its inertia.","Explanatory","Easy","2024-10-26 07:02:11"
"Why is it harder to move a heavy object than a light one?","It is harder to move a heavy object because it has more inertia due to its larger mass.","Explanatory","Easy","2024-10-26 07:02:11"
"What happens to a body in motion when there is no air resistance or friction?","A body in motion will continue to move if there is no air resistance or friction.","Explanatory","Easy","2024-10-26 07:02:11"
"Why do passengers in a bus lean backwards when the bus suddenly starts moving?","Passengers lean backwards due to the inertia of rest, which makes the upper part of their body lag behind.","Explanatory","Easy","2024-10-26 07:02:11"
"What is the purpose of wearing a seatbelt while driving?","Wearing a seatbelt is for safety, as it helps to prevent the body from moving forward due to inertia during sudden stops.","Explanatory","Easy","2024-10-26 07:02:11"
"What keeps a body in motion?","A body in motion will continue to move unless an external force acts upon it.","Explanatory","Easy","2024-10-26 07:02:11"
"What happens to the upper part of a passenger's body when a bus suddenly stops?","The upper part of the body moves forward due to inertia of motion.","Explanatory","Easy","2024-10-26 07:02:11"
"Why does a bicycle stop slowly after the rider stops pedaling?","A bicycle stops slowly due to the inertia of motion, which keeps it moving for a short distance.","Explanatory","Easy","2024-10-26 07:02:11"
"What is the qualitative concept of force related to Newton's First Law?","The qualitative concept of force is related to the idea that a body will maintain its state unless acted upon by an external force.","Explanatory","Easy","2024-10-26 07:02:11"
"Why is it easier to move a light object than a heavy one?","It is easier to move a light object because it has less inertia due to its smaller mass.","Explanatory","Easy","2024-10-26 07:02:11"
