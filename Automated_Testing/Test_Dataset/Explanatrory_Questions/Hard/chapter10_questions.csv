"How does the balance of protons and electrons in an atom determine its electrical properties?","The balance of protons and electrons in an atom determines its electrical properties because an equal number of protons and electrons makes the atom electrically neutral. If the number of electrons is not equal to the number of protons, the atom becomes charged. This occurs when there is a shortage or excess of electrons, resulting in the atom being positively or negatively charged.","Explanatory","Hard","2024-10-31 19:30:11"
"Explain why objects that have become charged through friction tend to attract neutral objects.","When an object becomes charged through friction, it gains or loses electrons, resulting in an imbalance of electric charge. This imbalance creates an electric field around the object. When a neutral object is brought near the charged object, the electric field induces a polarization in the neutral object, causing it to be attracted to the charged object.","Explanatory","Hard","2024-10-31 19:30:11"
"How does the process of induction cause the formation of charges on objects?","The process of induction occurs when a charged object is brought near a neutral object, causing the electrons in the neutral object to rearrange themselves.
