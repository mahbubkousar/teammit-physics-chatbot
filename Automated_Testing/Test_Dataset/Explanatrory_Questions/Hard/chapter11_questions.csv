"Explain how electric current is produced from static electricity, and describe the role of a conducting path in this process.","Electric current is produced from static electricity when a conducting path is provided, allowing the electrostatic charges to flow instead of being bound to the conductor. In an isolated charged conductor, the charge stays on its surface and does not move, but when a conducting path is established, the charges flow, and an electric current is produced. This process is demonstrated in a circuit, where a high voltage source charges up metal plates, and a conducting path is created by plugging in a key.","Explanatory","Hard","2024-10-31 19:31:20"
