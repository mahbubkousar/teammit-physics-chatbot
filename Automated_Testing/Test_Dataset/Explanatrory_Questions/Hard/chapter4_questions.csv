"How does the concept of work differ in science compared to everyday life, and what is the specific condition required for work to be done in science?","In science, the concept of work is different from that in everyday life, where work is associated with any activity. In science, work is done only when a force acts on a body and causes its displacement. This means that the force must result in the body moving in the direction of the force.","Explanatory","Hard","2024-10-31 19:21:08"
"Explain why a gateman guarding a house while sitting is not considered work in science, but the same gateman guarding the house while walking would be considered work.","The gateman guarding the house while sitting is not considered work in science because there is no displacement of the gateman's body in the direction of the force applied. On the other hand, if the gateman is walking while guarding the house, his body is displacing in the direction of the force applied, which means work is being done.","Explanatory","Hard","2024-10-31 19:21:08"
"How does the amount of work done depend on the applied force and distance, and what is the mathematical representation of work?","The amount of work done depends on the applied force and the distance traveled by the body in the direction of the force.
