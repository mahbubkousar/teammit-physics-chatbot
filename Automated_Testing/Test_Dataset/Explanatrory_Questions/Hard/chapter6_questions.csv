"How does the application or removal of heat affect the state of a substance?","The application or removal of heat transforms a substance from one state to another, causing changes in its shape, volume, and pressure. This transformation occurs because heat energy is transferred to or from the substance, affecting the motion of its molecules and altering its internal energy. As a result, the substance may change from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas.","Explanatory","Hard","2024-10-31 19:23:36"
"Explain the relationship between the motion of molecules and the sensation of hotness or coldness.","The motion of molecules in a substance is directly related to the sensation of hotness or coldness. When heat is applied to a substance, the motion of its molecules increases, resulting in an increase in kinetic energy. This increased motion is perceived as a sensation of hotness, while a decrease in motion is perceived as a sensation of coldness.","Explanatory","Hard","2024-10-31 19:23:36"
"Why does heat flow from a hotter body to a colder body?","Heat flows from a hotter body to a colder body due to the difference in temperature between the two bodies. The molecules in the hotter body have more kinetic energy and are moving rapidly, while the molecules in the colder body have less kinetic energy and are moving slowly. As a result, heat energy is transferred from the hotter body to the colder body, causing the molecules in the colder body to gain kinetic energy and move more rapidly.","Explanatory","Hard","2024-10-31 19:23:36"
"How does the temperature of a body determine whether it will receive or give up heat when in thermal contact with another body?","The temperature of a body determines whether it will receive or give up heat when in thermal contact with another body because it indicates the direction of heat flow. If a body is at a higher temperature than another body, it will give up heat to the colder body, while if it is at a lower temperature, it will receive heat from the hotter body.","Explanatory","Hard","2024-10-31 19:23:36"

However, it's the kinetic energy component of the internal energy that causes the raise of temperature.","Explanatory","Hard","2024-10-31 19:23:53"
"Why does the average equilibrium position of each molecule in a solid get displaced towards the exterior when heated?","When a solid is heated, the molecules vibrate with enhanced energy against the intermolecular force, causing them to approach further towards the exterior than towards the interior. This is because the repulsive force increases rapidly when the distance between molecules decreases, while the attractive force increases more slowly when the distance increases.","Explanatory","Hard","2024-10-31 19:23:53"
"How does the thermal expansion of a substance relate to the intermolecular force between its molecules?","The thermal expansion of a substance is inversely related to the intermolecular force between its molecules.

"Explain why the expansion of a liquid is lower than that of a gas when heated.","The expansion of a liquid is lower than that of a gas because the intermolecular force in a liquid is stronger than in a gas. As a result, the molecules in a liquid are more tightly bound together, making it more difficult for them to move apart and expand when heated.","Explanatory","Hard","2024-10-31 19:23:53"
"Why does the temperature difference of 1 K correspond to a temperature difference of 1°C?","The temperature difference of 1 K corresponds to a temperature difference of 1°C because the Kelvin scale and Celsius scale have the same unit of measurement, but with a different zero point.
