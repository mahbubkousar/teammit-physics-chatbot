"How does the pressure exerted on a surface change when the area decreases?","When the area decreases, the pressure exerted on the surface increases, assuming the force remains constant. This is because the same force is now acting on a smaller area, resulting in a greater force per unit area. As a result, the pressure increases. This is why sharp objects like knives or pins can easily pierce through surfaces when force is applied.","Explanatory","Moderate","2024-10-31 18:49:35"
"Explain why the sharp edge of a knife can easily cut through a substance when force is applied.","The sharp edge of a knife has a very small area, which means that when force is applied, the pressure exerted on the substance is very high. This high pressure allows the knife to easily cut through the substance. In contrast, a blunt object would not be able to exert the same amount of pressure, making it more difficult to cut through the substance.","Explanatory","Moderate","2024-10-31 18:49:35"
"Why is it easier to stand on a flat surface than on a pointed surface?","A flat surface has a larger area in contact with the ground, which means that the pressure exerted on the ground is lower. This makes it easier to stand on a flat surface. On the other hand, a pointed surface has a smaller area in contact with the ground, resulting in a higher pressure and making it more difficult to stand.","Explanatory","Moderate","2024-10-31 18:49:35"
"What is the relationship between force and pressure?","Pressure is directly proportional to the force applied. This means that if the force increases, the pressure also increases, assuming the area remains constant. Similarly, if the force decreases, the pressure also decreases.","Explanatory","Moderate","2024-10-31 18:49:35"
"How does the unit of pressure relate to the units of force and area?","The unit of pressure is the unit of force divided by the unit of area. In other words, pressure is force per unit area. This is why the unit of pressure is N/mÂ², which is also known as a pascal (Pa).","Explanatory","Moderate","2024-10-31 18:49:35"
"Explain why it is more painful to walk barefoot on a brick-chucked road than on a plain brick soling road.","A brick-chucked road has a smaller area in contact with the foot, resulting in a higher pressure on the foot.

A blunt pin, on the other hand, has a larger area in contact with the paper, resulting in a lower pressure and making it more difficult to hole the paper.","Explanatory","Moderate","2024-10-31 18:49:35"
"How does the area of a surface affect the pressure exerted on it?","The area of a surface is inversely proportional to the pressure exerted on it. This means that as the area increases, the pressure decreases, assuming the force remains constant. Similarly, as the area decreases, the pressure increases.","Explanatory","Moderate","2024-10-31 18:49:35"
"How does the density of an object determine whether it will float or sink in a fluid?","The density of an object determines whether it will float or sink in a fluid because if the object's density is less than the fluid's, it will experience an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced, allowing it to float. On the other hand, if the object's density is greater than the fluid's, it will experience a downward force due to gravity, causing it to sink. This is why a rotten egg, which has a lower density than water, floats, while a normal egg, with a higher density, sinks.","Explanatory","Moderate","2024-10-31 18:50:06"
"Explain why the atmospheric pressure on a person's body is not felt, despite being significant.","The atmospheric pressure on a person's body is not felt because the internal blood pressure of the human body is greater than the atmospheric pressure.

"Explain why the weight of a body appears to decrease when it is partially or fully immersed in a liquid.","The weight of a body appears to decrease when it is partially or fully immersed in a liquid because of the upward buoyant force exerted by the liquid on the body. According to Archimedes' principle, this buoyant force is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced by the body. As a result, the body seems to have lost a part of its weight when immersed in the liquid.","Explanatory","Moderate","2024-10-31 18:50:35"
"How does the design of a ship contribute to its stability in the water?","The design of a ship plays a crucial role in its stability in the water. A ship is designed such that the weight of the water displaced by the immersed part of the body is equal to the weight of the ship. This ensures that the ship remains stable and afloat. However, if the ship's design is defective or if it is overloaded, its centre of mass changes, leading to instability and accidents.","Explanatory","Moderate","2024-10-31 18:50:35"
"Explain the concept of Pascal's law and its significance in understanding the behavior of liquids and gases.","Pascal's law states that external pressure applied to any portion of an enclosed liquid or gas is equally transmitted in all directions without any diminution. This law is significant in understanding the behavior of liquids and gases, as it helps explain how pressure is transmitted and how forces are exerted on surfaces in contact with the liquid or gas.","Explanatory","Moderate","2024-10-31 18:50:35"
"Why do accidents occur frequently in waterways in Bangladesh?","Accidents occur frequently in waterways in Bangladesh due to various reasons, including overloading of ships, defective design of the ship, and failure to follow weather signals. When a ship is overloaded or its centre of mass changes, it loses stability and becomes prone to accidents.","Explanatory","Moderate","2024-10-31 18:50:35"
"How does the principle of multiplication of force work in Pascal's law?","The principle of multiplication of force in Pascal's law states that forces of greater magnitudes are exerted on pistons of greater cross-sectional area when force is applied to a smaller piston. This is because the pressure generated by the smaller piston is transmitted equally in all directions and acts perpendicularly on the surface of the container in contact with the liquid or gas.","Explanatory","Moderate","2024-10-31 18:50:35"
"Explain the difference between the weight of a body in air and its apparent weight when immersed in a liquid.","The weight of a body in air is its actual weight, whereas its apparent weight when immersed in a liquid is the weight it appears to have after being partially or fully immersed. The apparent weight is less than the actual weight due to the upward buoyant force exerted by the liquid on the body.","Explanatory","Moderate","2024-10-31 18:50:35"
"Why is it essential to follow the capacity limit of a ship to avoid accidents?","It is essential to follow the capacity limit of a ship to avoid accidents because overloading can cause the ship to lose stability and sink.
