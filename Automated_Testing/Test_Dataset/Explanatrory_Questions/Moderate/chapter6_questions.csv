"How does the sensation of hotness and coldness relate to heat energy, and what determines its flow from one body to another?","The sensation of hotness and coldness is created by heat energy, which flows from hotter to colder bodies due to a difference in temperature. This is because heat energy is a form of energy that is transferred from one body to another as a result of the difference in their temperatures. The direction of heat flow is determined by the temperature difference between the two bodies.","Explanatory","Moderate","2024-10-31 18:51:01"
"Why does the total amount of energy of a substance increase when heat is applied to it, and what role do the molecules play in this process?","The total amount of energy of a substance increases when heat is applied to it because the motion of the molecules increases, resulting in an increase in their kinetic energy. The molecules of a substance are always in a state of vibratory motion and possess kinetic energy, and when heat is applied, this motion increases, leading to an increase in the total energy of the substance.","Explanatory","Moderate","2024-10-31 18:51:01"
"Explain the concept of temperature and its role in determining whether a body will receive or give up heat when it comes into thermal contact with another body.","Temperature is a thermal condition of a body that determines whether the body will receive or give up heat when it comes into thermal contact with another body.
