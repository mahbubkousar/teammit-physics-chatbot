"How does light enable us to see objects around us?","Light enables us to see objects around us by entering our eyes and forming an image of the object in the retina. This image is then processed by the brain to create a sense of vision similar to the object being observed. This process occurs when light comes directly from the object or is reflected off the object's surface and into our eyes.","Explanatory","Moderate","2024-10-31 18:54:15"
"Why can we see non-luminous objects despite them not emitting their own light?","We can see non-luminous objects because light from luminous objects is reflected off their surface and into our eyes. This reflection of light allows us to perceive the non-luminous object, even though it does not emit its own light.","Explanatory","Moderate","2024-10-31 18:54:15"
"Explain the relationship between the incident and reflected rays of light during reflection.","During reflection, the incident and reflected rays of light obey two laws. Firstly, they lie in the same plane as the normal at the point of incidence on the reflector. Secondly, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. These laws govern how light behaves when it is reflected from a surface.","Explanatory","Moderate","2024-10-31 18:54:15"
"How does the nature of a surface affect the reflection of light?","The nature of a surface plays a significant role in determining how light is reflected from it. Different surfaces can cause light to reflect in various ways, depending on their properties. For example, smooth surfaces can produce a clear, specular reflection, while rough surfaces may produce a diffuse reflection.","Explanatory","Moderate","2024-10-31 18:54:15"
"Explain the concept of luminous and non-luminous objects in relation to light.","Luminous objects are those that emit their own light, such as the sun or a lighted candle.
