"A circuit consists of two resistors, R1 and R2, connected in parallel. If the total current in the circuit is 10 A and the voltage across the resistors is 12 V, what is the value of R1 if R2 is 2 ohms and the current through R1 is 6 A?","To find R1, first we need to find the total resistance in the circuit. We can use the formula I = V/R, where I is the total current and V is the voltage. Rearranging this formula to solve for R gives R = V/I. Substituting in the given values, we get R = 12/10 = 1.2 ohms. Since the resistors are connected in parallel, the total resistance is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances. We can use the formula 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2. Rearranging this formula to solve for R1 gives 1/R1 = 1/R_total - 1/R2. Substituting in the known values, we get 1/R1 = 1/1.2 - 1/2 = 0.833 - 0.5 = 0.333. Taking the reciprocal of this value gives R1 = 1/0.333 = 3 ohms.",Factual,Hard,10/24/2024 18:09
