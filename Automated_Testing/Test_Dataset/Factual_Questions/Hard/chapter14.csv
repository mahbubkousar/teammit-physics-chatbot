"A patient undergoes an MRI scan, which uses magnetic fields to create detailed images of the body.

If the energy of the X-rays is 100 keV, and the patient's body is assumed to be a perfect absorber, what is the energy deposited per unit mass of the body? (Assume the density of the body is 1000 kg/m³)","Using the formula for the energy deposited per unit mass, we can calculate the energy deposited: E/m = E / (ρ \* V), where E is the energy of the X-rays, ρ is the density of the body, and V is the volume of the body. However, we need to take into account the fact that the X-rays are absorbed by the body: E/m = E / (ρ \* (E / (ρ \* c))), where c is the speed of light. E/m = 100 keV / (1000 kg/m³ \* (100 keV / (1000 kg/m³ \* 3 x 10^8 m/s))) = 3.33 x 10^(-3) J/kg.",Factual,Hard,10/24/2024 18:15

If the thermistor has a resistance of 1000 Ω at 25°C and a temperature coefficient of -0.05 Ω/°C, what is the temperature of the body if the resistance of the thermistor is 950 Ω?","Using the formula for the temperature coefficient of resistance, we can calculate the temperature of the body: ΔR/R = α \* ΔT, where ΔR is the change in resistance, R is the initial resistance, α is the temperature coefficient, and ΔT is the change in temperature. Rearranging the formula to solve for ΔT, we get: ΔT = ΔR/(α \* R). ΔT = (1000 Ω - 950 Ω) / (-0.05 Ω/°C \* 1000 Ω) = 10°C. The temperature of the body is 35°C.",Factual,Hard,10/24/2024 18:15
