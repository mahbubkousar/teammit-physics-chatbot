If the person's mass is 70 kg and the coefficient of static friction between their feet and the bus floor is 0.5, what is the maximum force of static friction acting on the person?","F = m * a = 70 kg * (20 m/s - 0 m/s) / 10 s = 140 N. However, the maximum force of static friction is given by F = μs * N = μs * m * g = 0.5 * 70 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 343 N.

"If the car's brakes are applied and it comes to rest after 10 seconds, what is the average deceleration of the car? Use the concept of inertia to understand the car's tendency to maintain its state.","Since the car maintains its state due to inertia, an external force (braking) is required to change its state.
