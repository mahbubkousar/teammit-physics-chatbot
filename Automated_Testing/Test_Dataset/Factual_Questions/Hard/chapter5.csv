"If the density of the wood is 0.5 g/cm³ and the atmospheric pressure is 101325 Pa, what is the total upward force exerted on the block by the surrounding water?","First, we need to find the volume of the block. Since we are given the mass and density of the wood, we can use the formula: density = mass/volume. So, volume = mass/density = 2 kg / 0.5 g/cm³ = 4000 cm³. Since 30% of the block's volume is above the water's surface, 70% of the block's volume is submerged. The submerged volume is 4000 cm³ x 0.7 = 2800 cm³ = 0.0028 m³. The weight of the displaced water is equal to the weight of the block that is submerged. The weight of the displaced water is given by: weight = density x volume x g. We assume that the density of water is 1000 kg/m³. So, the weight of the displaced water is 1000 kg/m³ x 0.0028 m³ x 9.8 m/s² = 27.44 N. Therefore, the total upward force exerted on the block by the surrounding water is equal to the weight of the displaced water.",Factual,Hard,10/24/2024 17:15

"If she is wearing high heels with an area of 0.001 m², what is the force exerted on her feet?","Pressure = force/area. Rearranging, force = pressure x area. So, force = 4 x 10⁵ Pa x 0.001 m² = 400 N.",Factual,Hard,10/24/2024 17:15
What is its density?,Density = mass/volume = 10 kg / 0.01 m³ = 1000 kg/m³.,Factual,Hard,10/24/2024 17:15
"If a force of 1000 N is applied to the larger piston, what is the force exerted on the smaller piston?","Since the pressure is the same on both pistons, we can set up the equation: pressure = force/area. Since the pressure is the same on both pistons, we can equate the two expressions: force1/area1 = force2/area2. Rearranging, force2 = force1 x area2/area1. So, force2 = 1000 N x 0.01 m² / 0.1 m² = 100 N.",Factual,Hard,10/24/2024 17:15

The block has a mass of 2 kg and a volume of 0.004 m³. What is the weight of the water displaced by the block?,"Since the block is floating, it is in equilibrium, and the weight of the block is equal to the weight of the water displaced. The weight of the block is given by: weight = mass x g = 2 kg x 9.8 m/s² = 19.6 N. Therefore, the weight of the water displaced is also 19.6 N.",Factual,Hard,10/24/2024 17:15
