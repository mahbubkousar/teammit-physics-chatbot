Explain the sensations felt by the hands and the underlying reason for this phenomenon.,"The hand submerged in 25°C water will feel hot, while the hand submerged in higher temperature water initially will feel cooler. This is because our brain perceives temperature differences based on the change in heat flow. When the hands were submerged in 25°C water, they were losing heat to the cooler water. When submerged in 30°C water, the rate of heat loss from the hands slows down, giving the sensation of warmth. Conversely, the hand initially submerged in higher temperature water was losing heat more rapidly, so when submerged in 30°C water, the rate of heat loss increases, giving a sensation of coolness.",Factual,Hard,10/24/2024 17:18

"If the thermometer is immersed in a liquid at a temperature of 80°C, what will be the reading on the thermometer if it is suddenly transferred to a liquid at a temperature of 40°C? Assume the thermometer has a specific heat capacity of 0.2 J/g°C and a mass of 20 g.",The thermometer will initially be at a temperature of 80°C and will lose heat to the surrounding liquid at 40°C.
